__label__Activism __label__Environment toronto sep  chevron lawyers and corporate executives are fighting desperately to prevent critical and apparently embarrassing information from spilling over into public view during the highstakes enforcement trial over the ecuador environmental judgment that began this week in a canadian courtroomin the enforcement trial where ecuadorian rainforest communities are seeking to seize chevron assets after the company refused to pay the judgment against it critical information in the main brief of the communities remained heavily redacted on the second day of the fourday proceeding – resulting in the odd spectacle of the villagers themselves and their supporters watching the argument of their own lawyer with no real way to completely understand what was being said“i believe the public has a right to know what is my submissions” said alan lenczner the lawyer for the villagers to justice glen hainey who is presiding over the trial “there is a fundamental principle in canada of open court proceedings that chevron is not respecting and that this court must protect”lenczner considered one of canada’s foremost litigators for weeks has been trying to convince chevron to lift its “completely overbroad” confidentiality order according to argument in court yesterday lenczner claimed all of what chevron wants redacted from his briefs is available publicly in the company’s annual reports and securities filings and is therefore not proprietarylenczner also argued that chevron is obviously scared to have all the information about the corporate control of its subsidiary in one place rather than buried in obscure documents where the public would never be able to connect the dots that prove it is lying when it claims its canadian subsidiary chevron canada is an independent entitychevron owns of the company receives of its revenues and financially guarantees its projects said lenczner in the parts of his brief that were not redacted“information chevron wants to hide should not be kept from the public” said lenczner at that point some of the roughly chevron lawyers at the proceeding appeared visibly discomfited and one of them asked for the proceeding to be closed to the public until the issue could be resolved the information chevron is trying to hide mostly concerns the obvious “domination” by chevron corporation of chevron canada as well as the extent of chevron’s canada’s substantial assets in the country which are estimated to be worth between billion and billion the communities are trying to collect of billion environmental judgment plus statutory interest under canadian law which has raised chevron’s total liability to close to billion after an eightyear trial in chevron’s chosen forum of ecuador three layers of courts found that texaco now owned by chevron deliberately and systematically dumped billions of gallons of benzeneladen oil waste into streams and rivers poisoning the water supply and decimating indigenous and farmer communities that populate the isolated area with high cancer rates and other health problems chevron quietly sold off its assets in ecuador during the trial and now refuses to pay the judgment with a spokesman saying the company plans to create a “lifetime of litigation” for the communities to punish them for bringing their claimschevron for years had insisted the trial over its pollution be held in ecuador and promised to abide by any judgment there when it requested that a us federal court where the pollution claims were originally filed in send the case to the south american nation once there and with evidence of its pollution mounting chevron turned its guns on ecuador’s courts and accused them of being unfair chevron is now asking – after years of litigation – to relitigate the entire trial in canada which the affected communities oppose paul paz y mino associate director of amazon watch and a supporter of the affected communities who is observing the proceedings in canada blasted chevron for hiding the information and generally trying to delay and obstruct the canadian proceedings “everybody in court can see chevron canada is taking orders directly from chevron corporation and its lawyers including many of its usbased lawyers from the law firm of gibson dunn who are taking up a huge number of the seats in the courtroom” he said “it is typical of chevron to try to hide the reality of the way it operates from its shareholders and the public” in an unredacted part of his brief lenczner described chevron’s control of its canadian subsidiary as follows“chevron earns no revenue and has no direct earnings all of its money comes from subsidiaries that carry out its extractive business functions in four years a total of billion has been paid to chevron from revenue earned by chevron subsidiaries” yet in another part of the redacted brief available lenczner appears to outline substantial monies chevron canada borrowed from chevron to fund its own investments all of chevron canada’s revenues flowed up to chevron corporation according to the brief the brief also outlines some of the many monetary guarantees made by chevron on behalf of chevron canadathe issue of chevron’s control of chevron canada is critical because chevron is trying to block enforcement of the judgment in canada by making the technical argument that the communities could never collect its assets in the country because they are held by a wholly owned but “independent” subsidiary rather than by chevron itself chevron has never disputed that texaco created extensive contamination in ecuador its main argument is that it is not responsible for paying the judgment even though it willingly assumed texaco’s liabilities when it bought the company in lenczner has argued that the communities are entitled to seize the shares of chevron canada to collect a debt that chevron owes them and that the issue has nothing to do with corporate law or subsidiary liability the canada supreme court already unanimously when chevron tried to use jurisdictional grounds block the enforcement proceeding which was filed in background on the first day of the proceedings where chevron’s lawyers made their longwinded arguments related to subsidiary liability see on wednesday the court began to hear argument on the motion by the communities to knock out chevron’s “fraud” defense on the theory that it is based on fabricated evidence and already had been rejected by ecuador’s courts in the years of proceedings in that countryfor background on the canadian enforcement proceeding see for journalists and observers on the canadian enforcement action and its policy implications for the most important legal filing

liability to the people of ecuadorin a more than one dozen canadian organizations including friends of the earth greenpeace idle no more canada miningwatch sierra club and sierra club british columbia united steelworkers and unifor condemned chevron not only for its actions in ecuador but its efforts to silence critics and abuse the civil justice system to evade paying the ecuador judgmentthe letter was published less than a week before a trial is scheduled to begin in toronto to seize chevron’s assets in canada to force the company to comply with its liability to remediate what many call the “amazon chernobyl” in ecuador chevron confessed to deliberately dumping billions of gallons of toxic oil drilling waters over the course of decades in ecuador’s amazon resulting in massive environmental devastation and a health crisis affecting thousands of people every court that has considered the evidence in ecuador – including the country’s supreme court ruled against chevron yet the company still refuses to pay and has dragged out multiple legal battles in different countries over the course of decades to avoid paying for a cleanup as a result the communities in ecuador affected by the pollution have been forced to pursue chevron to canada to collect on the company’s debtthe letter also calls on canadian authorities to prevent chevron from selling any of its canadian assets before a decision can be reached in the trial stating that it “would set a terrible precedent for other corporations intending to evade responsibility for environmental and human rights crimes” it has been reported recently that of its estimated us billion in canadian assets chevron after insisting the trial take place in ecuador and promising to abide by any judgment there stripped its assets from the country as the evidence mounted against it the trial in ecuador lasted from to largely because of the company’s deliberate strategy of delay“the global community knows chevron is guilty of deliberate and massive contamination in ecuador” said paul paz y miño associate director of amazon watch “wherever chevron runs to try to escape justice the company will find itself already exposed as a global polluter and corporate criminal”“the canadian environmental and human rights community has joined forces with the affected communities in ecuador because we recognize this to be one of the most important corporate accountability cases in history” said melina laboucanmassimo climate energy campaigner with greenpeace canada “chevron must not be allowed to evade its legal and moral responsibilities simply because it has the might to fight on indefinitely in the courts” she continued“canadians want justice for ecuador’s indigenous people prime minister trudeau should help them get it” added beatrice olivastri ceo friends of the earth canada canadians are working to make our country a place where the victims of transnational corporations can find justice not to deny justice to people who have already suffered so much harm said jamie kneen communications and outreach coordinator of miningwatch canada“for too long oil companies have operated with impunity leaving a legacy of environmental destruction and human rights abuses” said sierra club bc campaigns director caitlyn vernon “whether in canada or around the world oil companies such as chevron enbridge and kinder morgan must be held accountable for oil spills climate change impacts and their treatment of local and indigenous populations”“the people of canada are not fooled by chevron’s tactic of smearing the very people it poisoned in an attempt to escape justice for crimes it admitted to in ecuador” said kevin koenig amazon watch’s ecuador program director “the supreme court of canada sided with the ecuadorians unanimously and we expect chevron will lose once again“unlike chevron’s retaliatory the company will have to respond in canada based on the merits of the case and its actual conduct in ecuador” koenig added “chevron stands no chance of winning on those grounds it’s time for the company’s management team to stop delaying the inevitable because every day it drags this case on more ecuadorians get sick and die from toxic contamination and the more the company’s own reputation suffers”we are grateful that the people of canada just like their supreme court have chosen to side with those of us affected by chevron’s deplorable actions when it polluted our communities and water supply the indigenous peoples of ecuador deserve full access to justice and a healthy environment so that we and our amazonian neighbors can live with dignity” said humberto piaguaje president of the union of affected communities in ecuador who will be in attendance,

__label__Activism __label__Environment toronto sep  a group of ecuadorian indigenous groups and farmer communities from the rainforest will ask a canadian judge monday to stop chevron from seeking to evade a billion environmental damages award resulting from a lawsuit filed years agoafter a fouryear delay in canada caused by chevron’s pretrial maneuvering – which came on top of a trial in ecuador the amazon communities are seeking to enforce a ecuador court judgment against the oil giant chevron submitted to jurisdiction in ecuador in but later sold all of its assets there and has refused to pay the multibillion dollar penalty imposed after the company admitted to systematically dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest in the and “we are urging canada’s courts to move quickly because many people including children are sick and dying from the contamination chevron left behind on our ancestral lands and the company continues to disrespect legal rulings” said carlos guaman president of the amazon defense coalition the grass roots organization that brought the original lawsuit on behalf of roughly indigenous and farmer communities in ecuador’s amazon“chevron’s strategy for over two decades has been to throw sand into the gears of the judicial process by forum shopping and manipulating evidence which we are prepared to show canadian courts” guaman added “the bottom line is that chevron’s strategy of lawsuit abuse must be stopped” for journalists and observers on the canadian enforcement action and its policy implicationsan eightyear ecuador trial which generated more than pages of evidence resulted in a finding that chevron deliberately dumped billion gallons of toxic oil waste into streams and rivers and abandoned about waste pits filled with oil sludge which to this day continue to contaminate soils and groundwater chevron operated in ecuador under the texaco brand from to the ecuador trial court judgment was upheld unanimously by two appellate courts including the country’s supreme court in a chevron tried to block the enforcement action in canada until the country’s in a unanimous opinion issued last year chevron has an estimated billion to billion in assets in the country including oil production facilities a refinery in british columbia and the athabasca oil sands project in alberta a fiveday motions hearing beginning monday will help determine both the scope of the enforcement trial and the timetable for the possible seizure of chevron assets the judgment against chevron is now worth roughly billion because of statutory interest under canadian lawtwo key legal issues will be determined at the motions hearingfirst the ecuadorians will seek to knock out all of chevron’s “fraud” defenses because three separate ecuador courts have considered chevron’s evidence and rejected its validity – courts where chevron chose to conduct the trial according to legal papers filed by alan lenczner the canadian trial lawyershould the canadian judge allow chevron’s claimed evidence of fraud counsel for the ecuadorians stands ready to present ample evidence proving the oil major conspired to fabricate its fraud claims to taint the judgment and to deceive foreign enforcement courts said aaron marr page a us legal advisor to the villagers “while we don’t think canada’s court should let chevron relitigate yet again its bogus fraud allegations we are prepared to present evidence that will conclusively blow up those allegations in open court if necessary” said pagesecondly the ecuadorians plan to block a chevron motion that seeks a ruling that the company’s canadian assets cannot be seized because they are owned by a whollyowned chevron subsidiary called chevron canada rather than by chevron itself the ecuadorians have rejected chevron’s argument as “illogical” and “preposterous” and predict the court will deny the company’s attempt to hide behind corporate technicalities to evade paying what it owes to the impoverished villagers many of whom and other health impacts due to the pollution added pagechevron is essentially asking the canada court to relitigate the entire ecuador trial which is something the villagers say is barred by a long tradition in canadian law regarding the enforcement of foreign judgments by scofflaw companies that refuse to pay their debts the only relevant issue say the lawyers for the villagers is whether the company was afforded due process in ecuador where it accepted jurisdiction and whether it raised its complaints in the forum where it wanted the trial held – or could have raised them with proper due diligence chevron’s fraud evidence comes largely from one witness – a former ecuadorian judge named alberto guerra guerra in a separate arbitration proceeding about key parts of his testimony in a retaliatory us “racketeering” case filed by chevron against the villagers and their lawyers also chevron for his testimony and given him a slew of other benefits including moving him and his entire extended family from ecuador to the united states guerra had no corroborating evidence for the bribe allegation and the villagers say his testimony had so little credibility that there is a serious question whether a court will even let him testifyon the socalled “ghostwriting” issue also based largely on guerra’s false testimony a by one of the world’s leading computer authorities definitively proves the ecuador trial court judgment was written by the trial judge on his office computer – not given to him on a flash drive by someone else as guerra falsely testified for background on how chevron’s key evidentiary planks in its “fraud” narrative have unraveled in recent months see published by the huffington post recently a us appellate court upheld a lower court decision by judge lewis a kaplan that the ecuador judgment could not be enforced in the us however both us courts said the ecuador judgment could be enforced in other countries the lower court also said it was not ruling on the validity of the judgmentthe kaplan decision was rubberstamped without any independent analysis of his factual findings by a threeperson appellate panel because under us law appellate courts are always required to accept the lower court’s findings without engaging in a de novo review the particular appellate court that rubberstamped kaplan – based on new york – has grown increasingly hostile toward human rights victims from other countries including the victims of the union carbide chemical disaster in india that resulted in widespread death said pagealan lenczner the canadian lawyer for the villagers strongly criticized the kaplan decision in his to the canadian court“the illogicality of the proceeding before judge kaplan is stark” he wrote “judge kaplan knew that the sole purpose of the action before him was to influence a foreign court that had the foreign judgment squarely before it for enforcement“the us judgment does not respect comity or the ability of foreign courts to apply their own laws appropriately” he added “the supreme court of canada did not pay heed to judge kaplan’s decision when it was raised before it” for the most important legal filing by the villagers for the motions hearing see for a summary of the canadian supreme court

__label__Activism __label__Environment new york sep  in a new legal filing the lawyer for new york criticized a us federal appellate court’s decision in favor of chevron on the billion ecuador environmental judgment as “lawless” and urged the entire court to rehear the case taking into account critical new evidence that completely undermines the main factual basis for the prior ruling a prominent appellate lawyer who represents donziger is seeking a rehearing by the full second circuit court of appeals in new york on various grounds including that the decision contradicts rulings from separate appellate judges in canada and ecuador who have affirmed all or parts of the extensive findings that chevron dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest decimating indigenous groups and causing an that has killed or threatens to kill thousands of peoplein his gupta outlined multiple elements of the appellate court’s decision – which found the ecuador judgment was obtained by “fraud” a fact that contradicts findings by three layers of courts in ecuador that are illegal and unprecedented in us jurisprudence gupta also attacked the court’s refusal to reconsider the of controversial us trial judge louis a kaplan who along with the appellate court ignored powerful new evidence that nullifies chevron’s claims that the ecuador judgment was the product of bribery“make no mistake mr donziger has consistently vigorously denied the allegations against him – including the outrageous shifting tale of bribery and ghostwriting by the star witness made rich by chevron” after being paid more than million by the oil company gupta’s filing statedthe critical new evidence ignored by the court includes that proves the trial judge in ecuador wrote the decision against chevron on his office computer contrary to the claim by chevron’s paid witness that it was written elsewhere and given to the judge on a flash drive it also includes the recent admission by chevron’s star witness alberto guerra that in kaplan’s courtroom after being coached for consecutive days by chevron’s lawyers at the us law firm gibson dunn crutcherdonziger’s request for a rehearing is largely a moot point for chevron which is still on the hook in canada for the entirety of the ecuador judgment plus interest after a by the rainforest communities before canada’s supreme court earlier this month over chevron’s objections in that country to seize company assets to pay for the ecuador judgment the canadian judge said he would and that he would allow the ecuadorians to present the critical new evidence that undermines kaplan and the us appellate court dealing a major setback to chevron’s strategy to evade paying for a cleanup in ecuadorthe underlying environmental case against chevron originally was filed in us federal court in but shifted to ecuador in at the oil giant’s request after it accepted jurisdiction there and promised to pay any adverse judgment not only did chevron violate its promises the company sold off its assets in ecuador and threatened the rainforest communities with a “lifetime of litigation” as punishment for pursuing their claims in the meantime three layers of courts in chevron’s chosen forum – including ecuador’s supreme court – found unanimously that the company operating as texaco deliberately dumped billions of gallons of toxic oil waste into streams and rivers when it operated in ecuador’s amazon region from to the dumping led to an and decimated the traditions of five indigenous groups in the arealawyers for the affected ecuadorian communities repeatedly have blasted kaplan’s socalled factual “findings” that the ecuador judgment was the product of fraud in various filings they have asserted chevron fabricated made illegal payments of at least million to guerra who later and took advantage of who in chevron during the trial and who repeatedly made offensive comments about the ecuadorian villagers according to prominent trial lawyer john keker chevron also worked with kaplan to create in the courtroom where the judge repeatedly refused to hear evidence offered by donziger and the ecuadorians including the extensive scientific proof that chevron systematically dumped toxic waste at roughly separate sites in the amazon and then implemented a sham remediation to try to evade legal responsibility for a copy of donziger’s sworn testimony in the case see in separate comments donziger said he was “deeply disappointed” with the second circuit panel for “rubberstamping” the erroneous findings of the trial judge without independent analysis “the panel ignored the deep flaws in the proceeding below and refused to consider critical new evidence that blows up chevron’s bogus fraud narrative including an admission by the company’s paid witness that he lied to frame me with a false allegation of bribery” said donziger “guerra’s testimony itself is part of criminal activity by chevron and its lawyers to evade paying compensation due the people of ecuador by implementing a strategy to demonize the lawyers who helped hold the company accountable”donziger added “the appellate panel’s decision not only ignored critical factual developments that nullify the district court’s findings it sidestepped profoundly important legal questions that could have a huge and negative impact on constitutionallyprotected advocacy in our society the second circuit looks very much like it is engaged a brazen attempt to protect the interests of a powerful american oil company from an adverse decision by a foreign court rather than issue a ruling grounded in the facts and the law that’s the only way i can explain how this normally esteemed court deviated so profoundly from established law”gupta’s petition asserted the court was mistaken on several counts as followsthe decision affirming kaplan’s ruling represents the first time that us court has allowed a party that lost a money judgment in a foreign country where it wanted the trial held to preemptively attack that judgment in a us court violating comity and upsetting the normal functioning of international lawthe decision violates a previous second circuit panel’s decision in the same case that barred a collateral attack on a foreign judgment in us courtsin a blatant example of judicial imperialism the decision contravenes a ruling of the highest court in a foreign country on a question of that country’s own lawthe decision ignores critical factual developments since the end of the kaplan trial that render the findings of the judge – who gupta says never had the legal authority to take the case – completely moot“the panel’s lawless opinion can only be explained by its mistaken belief that appellant steven donziger has not challenged the facts bringing to mind the adage that bad facts make bad law” said gupta “but facts are not the same as fact findings the district court erected a fortress a hundreds of pages of alternative findings and driveby credibility determinations many embedded in one of nearly footnotes so that they could not be challenged on appeal”gupta emphasized that the second circuit panel that heard the ecuador case – comprised of judges barrington d parker amalya l kearse and richard c wesley – ignored the evidence that chevron witness guerra lied on several critical points that kaplan relied on for his findings the panel also ignored that proves the trial judge authored the judgment contrary to chevron’s claims that it was secretly written by the plaintiffs chevron’s lawyers at the us law firm of gibson dunn crutcher led by randy mastro avi weitzman reed brodsky and andrea neumann – elaborately coached guerra for close to two months before allowing him to testify donziger has said mastro and the gibson dunn team actually coached guerra to lie a fact which when being crossexamined under oath in a separate arbitration proceeding between chevron and ecuador’s government evidence also emerged that mastro and his team directly negotiated chevron’s compensation to guerra at the same time they were helping to shape his testimony – a huge ethical breach said donzigerkaplan also trial despite the fact chevron originally sued them for roughly billion – thought to be the highest potential liability for any individual in us history in an act that donziger called cowardly chevron dropped its entire damages claim on the eve of trial and only sought injunctive relief so that kaplan could decide the case alone under the us constitution a defendant in a civil case only receives a jury trial if he is being sued for moneydonziger said he hoped the second circuit would regard the latest petition as an opportunity to correct not only the flaws in its ecuador decision but also its reputation as a court worldwide by a prominent international legal group representing victims of the bhopal disaster in india said the second circuit had become a “graveyard” for human rights claims another commentator the canadian joe emersberger recently about the court with regard to claims by thousands of haitians who died of cholera after un troops negligently dumped raw sewage in a river only to be denied the right to sue by the same court“unfortunately the second circuit has become known around the world as a dead end for human rights victims when those victims challenge powerful corporate or institutional interests” said donziger “my hope is that the full court will have the foresight to rethink some of these important human rights issues in the context of the ecuador case where thousands of rainforest inhabitants continue to suffer and die due to chevron’s stubborn refusal to comply with the rule of law and address its legal and moral obligations”two ecuadorian villagers who appeared in the kaplan proceeding javier piaguaje and hugo camacho also joined in the petition for a rehearing by the full court their brief

__label__Environment  toronto sep  the lawyer for ecuadorian villagers in the trial to enforce the billion ecuador judgment said he was ready to question chevron’s star witness alberto guerra on the stand about his false allegations of bribery but that chevron appears “afraid” to bring him up to canada for grilling in open courtand in another stunning setback for chevron in canada the oil giant’s lawyers admitted last week in open court that a canadian judge will make his own factual determination and not be bound by the findings of a controversial us trial judge about whether the ecuador environmental judgment can be enforced against chevron’s assets in canada chevron’s admission is a significant advance for ecuadorian rainforest communities trying to remediate oil pollution on their ancestral lands the flurry of admissions and argument took place during a fourday motions hearing last week in toronto that is expected to determine the scope of the enforcement trial targeting chevron’s assets to force the company to comply with the ecuador environmental judgment chevron has at least billion of assets in canada or more than enough to pay the entirety of the judgment plus interest chevron is trying to avoid a trial altogether by arguing that the communities could never collect assets in canada because they are held by a whollyowned subsidiary the ecuadorian communities have proposed a compromise that would include a minitrial on two discrete issues related to chevron allegations of bribery and ghostwriting but nothing else justice glen hainey is expected to rule on the pretrial issues in the coming weeks with an enforcement trial likely to take place in ’s admission that the findings of us judge lewis a kaplan have little relevance to the canadian proceeding is critically important for years the company has tried to argue that canadian courts should defer wholesale to kaplan’s findings that the judgment in ecuador is fraudulent a determination contrary to the findings of three courts in ecuador that – unlike kaplan heard the fully panoply of evidence against the oil giantkaplan based his “fraud” findings largely on the controversial testimony from guerra who was paid more than million by the company and who later on the stand kaplan also refused to consider voluminous technical and scientific evidence demonstrating the oil giant’s toxic dumping in ecuador and he made comments from the bench that members of the affected rainforest communities considered highly offensive among other deep flaws in his proceeding kaplan also did not disclose that while ruling in favor of the oil company lenczner said he was ready for guerra who was coached by the oil giant’s lawyers for a whopping days before being allowed to testify in open court in the us“bottom line is that we are not here to determine what kaplan found or didn’t find” lenczner told the court “we are here to determine what chevron brought forward to the ecuador courts… what is also clear that the findings of kaplan have no legs but if they say there is a bribe let’s have a trial on the bribe and bring guerra here and i will tell you chevron is afraid to bring guerra into this courtroom”lenczner later repeated to hainey that if the canadian court wanted to litigate chevron’s supposed evidence about an alleged offer of a bribe then “bring it on… let’s bring up alberto guerra and have a trial on the bribe we will fight like hell till it freezes over and then fight it out on the ice just like chevron said it would”aaron marr page a us legal advisor to the rainforest communities also praised the independence of canadian courts in not deferring to kaplan’s findings canada’s supreme court already and in favor of the villagers on a key jurisdictional question that the oil giant had used to try to block the enforcement action sending the matter back to the ontario trial court in toronto “what chevron really wants is for the canadian courts to defer to kaplan’s flawed findings point by point which is something that will never happen” said page “chevron also knows any such argument is baseless and even insulting – canadian courts are plenty capable of making their own findings and certainly do not look kindly on findings based on paid ‘fact’ witness testimony and countless other procedural abuses of the sort that took place before kaplan”“chevron’s admission in canada that kaplan’s erroneous factual findings will have little if any relevance is a huge victory for the affected communities and demonstrates how the company’s legal position is weakening” added pagein the motions hearing attended by roughly two dozen lawyers and executives from chevron the company ran headlong into the reality that its “fraud” narrative adopted by kaplan could easily blow up in canada potentially forcing payment of the entire ecuador court judgment chevron has spent an estimated billion on more than to avoid precisely that outcomejustice hainey the canadian judge made it clear that he would be making his own determination – one that likely will be based at least in part on key evidence that kaplan refused to consider say lawyers for the affected communities this not only includes the evidence that guerra but also that proves chevron falsified evidence before kaplan on the issue of the authorship of the ecuador trial court judgment a former ecuador judge who admitted to accepting bribes while on the bench guerra remains the centerpiece of a chevron narrative initiated to try to taint the ecuador judgment almost months after kaplan ruled guerra during a related arbitration dispute between the government of ecuador and chevronby ecuador’s highest court – ruling in the country where chevron insisted the trial be held and where it had accepted jurisdiction – affirmed that chevron as responsible for the intentional dumping of billions of gallons of toxic water into streams and rivers used by locals for their drinking water for the unanimous ecuador supreme court ruling see according to several independent studies the company also was found to have abandoned roughly toxic waste pits gouged out of the jungle floor which continue to contaminate soils and groundwater according to expert evidencebecause chevron sold all of its assets in ecuador as the evidence mounted against it during the ecuador phase of the trial the ecuadorians have been forced to seek payment of the damage award in other jurisdictions chevron has an estimated to billion in assets in canadachevron also is trying to make the technical argument to justice hainey that the enforcement trial should not take place at all because the company’s assets are held by a whollyowned subsidiary called chevron canada not by chevron itself that argument has very little chance of prevailing said lenczner in he submitted on the questionin ontario the ecuadorians also are arguing canadian and international law preclude chevron from relitigating what the ecuador courts have ruled on already or from hearing evidence that was available to chevron to present lenczner said chevron knew of guerra’s nowdisputed evidence when it appealed the lower court’s judgment in ecuador but did not present it nevertheless he said that “as a compromise with the court” the ecuadorians are prepared to have a “minitrial on the bribery and ghostwriting charges” involving guerras testimonyin his recantation guerra conceded that he was not offered payments by the villagers as he had testified and that he had told chevron the lie only to increase company payments to him chevron has signed two contracts with guerra paying him a monthly salary of even though he was paid only monthly in his last job in ecuador chevron also pays guerras health insurance the fees for an immigration lawyer for him and his entire family and his federal income taxes in the united states as well as other expenseslenczner also said “impressive” evidence showed chevron received a fair trial in ecuador he said “i’ll show you involvement pages of evidence expert reports site visits chevron participated at every level the company brought motions pages of new evidence was submitted to the intermediate court of appeal and another pages was submitted to the national supreme court”the villagers originally filed their claims against chevron in in us federal court before the company shifted the case to ecuador by promising to abide by any judgment issued there chevron later reneged on that promise and promised the villagers a “lifetime of litigation” if they persisted in pursuing their claims,

 __label__Health-&-Wellness toronto canada jul  is proud to announce the recipients of the metlife foundation awards for medical research in alzheimer’s disease this is the year that metlife foundation has presented these prestigious awards to outstanding researchers in the field of alzheimer’s disease at the heart of the program is a belief in research as the road to understanding and ultimately treating this devastating disease this year metlife foundation is presenting awards in categories totaling awards will be presented by metlife foundation president and chief executive officer dennis white during the morning plenary session of the alzheimer’s association international conference on “metlife foundation is proud to present the major awards to dr bu and dr kivipelto for their exceptional scientific research contributions which help bring us closer to finding a cure for alzheimer’s disease and related dementias” notes a dennis white president and chief executive officer metlife foundation “their outstanding contributions recognized around the world have helped us better understand this devastating illness and both awardees have laid the groundwork leading to effective treatments”white continues “our advisory committee were so impressed by the potential impact of dr slutsky and dr cirrito’s research that they have granted them the promising investigator awards this year”according to recent estimates without the development of treatments that either delay the onset or slow the progression of alzheimer’s disease by as many as million people worldwide will be living with the diseasethe evening of the plenary session the awardees will share their insights at a research briefing for an exclusive audience of past awardees and leaders in the field “as we recognize thirty years of excellence in alzheimer’s research through these awards” notes white “metlife foundation is proud and humbled that our support has helped work toward a cure for this devastating disease”guojun bu phd’s breakthrough discoveries focused on the cell surface receptor called dr bu researched the receptor’s role in liver function and discovered that one of its binding partners is apolipoprotein e or apoe when it was discovered that carriers of gene for the protein called were at significantly greater risk of developing alzheimer’s in later life dr bu focused his attention on understanding the biology of apoe and its receptors as they relate to the pathology of alzheimer’s and related dementia over the last years dr bu’s lab has produced over peerreviewed articles that have been cited over times his team’s contributions to alzheimer’s research rank among the most significant in the field alzheimer’s disease prevention has become a primary focus of dr bu’s research one prevention target is addressing the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brains of people who are known to be at increased risk of developing alzheimer’s dr bu is involved with prevention trials and believes this is where we will see the greatest success in coming years his team includes chemists who can help develop drugs from the compounds they are researching dr bu’s work exemplifies his ability to foster the collaborative teambased science needed to facilitate the passing of scientific discoveries from patients to the bench and back to patients in the form of effective treatments was the principal investigator on a study titled cardiovascular risk factors aging and incidence of dementia or caide caide is one of the first research projects linking midlife vascular condition and lifestyle factors with people’s risk of latelife dementia including alzheimer’s disease dr kivipelto’s data suggested that starting and sustaining common preventive strategies twenty years before symptoms of agerelated dementia typically appear could significantly reduce and delay cognitive decline in dr kivipelto introduced the caide dementia risk score the first tool for predicting the likelihood of an individual developing dementia based on his or her midlife risk profile dr kivipelto went on to expand her research into the now landmark finnish geriatric intervention study to prevent cognitive impairment and disability also known as finger this is the first large randomized controlled trial seeking to prevent alzheimer’s disease and thereby substantially reduce both individual suffering and the societal costs of the alzheimer’s epidemic dr kivipelto’s next goal is to enable clinicians to tailor specific prevention strategies to individual cases with that goal in mind she is leading several collaborative initiatives including a particularly ambitious project called multimode which hopes to produce and commercialize two evidencebased ehealth tools to predict dementia risk and prevent alzheimer’s among atrisk populations the goals of multimode are to promote healthy living through lifestyle interventions and to encourage selfmanagement of health was a graduate student when he appreciated that amyloid beta in the fluid around brain cells gave rise to the amyloid plaques in alzheimer’s disease but there was no way of measuring how much amyloid beta was actually in that brain fluid he set out to fill this gap in the research dr cirrito developed a method for measuring amyloid beta in the fluid around brain cells his technique allowed tracking of levels every hour in a living freely moving mouse by making adjustments to these mouse models—such as age sleep patterns levels of activity or drug treatments—dr cirrito and his team were able to show cause and effect relationships between various conditions and amyloid beta production and clearance in a living brain his protocol has since been adopted by eight other laboratories he has recently developed a new technology to measure brain amyloid beta every seconds dr cirrito’s work is relevant to any therapeutic strategies looking to enhance clearance of amyloid beta has been researching how memories are created and maintained and what causes individuals to lose their ability to remember dr slutsky has focused her research on the breakdown of lines communication between brain cells in particular in the pathology of alzheimer’s disease among the many insights her team has learned is that amyloid beta has a critical role in normal brain activity she discovered that communication between cells is compromised when production of amyloid beta around synapses is blocked her results predict that lowering the protein’s concentration too far might be just as damaging as a higher toxic level of amyloid beta accumulationin focusing on alzheimer’s disease dr slutsky has identified specific properties of synaptic activity that regulate the levels of various forms of amyloid beta her goal is to set the groundwork for establishing guidelines and therapies for maintaining the optimal balance of amyloid beta isoforms in a healthy brain dr slutsky’s work has significant implications for the development of any treatment targeting amyloid beta accumulation or clearance now in their year the metlife foundation awards for medical research in alzheimer’s disease provide outstanding researchers with an opportunity to freely pursue new ideas at the heart of the program is a belief in research as the road to understanding and ultimately treating this

__label__Activism __label__Environment quito ecuador jul  the grass roots organization representing the dozens of rainforest communities that won a historic billion environmental judgment against chevron announced the appointment of a new ecuadorian legal team to reimpose an embargo order against the oil giant’s assets in ecuador after a previous order was secretly lifted without proper notice by another lawyerthe organization the frente de defensa de la amazonia “fda” – known also by its english name amazon defense coalition – strongly criticized ecuadorian attorney pablo fajardo who last week lifted the embargo order the same as a lien against chevron assets in ecuador to make it easier for ecuador’s government to make a controversial payment of million to the company fajardo took the action without the permission of the fda which would have been entitled to the funds under the lien if the embargo order had remained in placefajardo and any other person involved in the lifting of the lien could be liable for damages or otherwise sanctioned said carlos guaman the president of the fda who released a statement today on behalf of the organization guaman also said the fda leadership had decided to immediately suspend ties to fajardo pending the outcome of an internal investigation exploring the circumstances surrounding the action and why it happened the organization named patricio salazar a prominent ecuadorian lawyer to lead the investigation and to represent the organization going forward along with several international lawyers“this is an unfortunate situation that appears to reflect a serious error in judgment by mr fajardo who in our opinion was clearly operating outside the scope of his authority” said guaman “community leaders were living in the dark for days not knowing that a lawyer on our team had compromised our rights to these cleanup funds mr fajardo’s action not only denies the communities any possibility of immediately mitigating the impacts of chevron’s pollution but potentially undermines asset seizure actions against the company in other countries “our plan is to use our team of lawyers and advisors under mr salazar’s leadership to correct this matter and to make sure systems are in place so this type of mistake does not happen again” guaman added the fda had intended to use the million paid to chevron to begin planning a longawaited cleanup of the environmental damage caused by the company and to provide health care to those affected by the pollution in accordance with the ecuadorian judgment said guamanthe move by fajardo to lift the embargo order without the prior approval or even the notification of the fda which is the sole fiduciary of the billion ecuador judgment stunned the organization and the various communities and organizations that comprise its membership the action – apparently done at the behest of individuals in ecuador’s government that wanted to pay chevron after the company won an arbitral award in an unrelated case was first reported by ecuavisa a television news outlet in ecuador several days after the embargo had been lifted another fda leader and member of the group’s executive committee orlando guzman said in response to the lifting of the order “first and foremost all lawyers representing the communities must be guided by their professional ethics in service of their clients even if they have sympathy for the difficult situation that ecuador’s government was in due to chevron’s unjustified pressure what is clear to the fda is that mr fajardo was not authorized to take such action without getting prior approval from the organization and the communities which did not happen said approval never would have been granted had we known about this in fact mr fajardo himself is potentially liable personally to his own clients for damages caused including the amount of funds that were lost” salazar said he would explore what new measures might be taken to seize any chevron assets that might appear in ecuador although chevron stripped most of its assets from the country during the eightyear trial that resulted in the judgment the company still has potential assets in the form of future court judgments and payments to its local legal team that could be monetized by the communities as they enforce their judgment he said “we must be prepared to take advantage of any opportunity to enforce the judgment in ecuador and elsewhere against chevron assets” salazar said guaman said it was important to clarify the fda’s authority over the environmental judgment against chevronthe fda is the sole fiduciary responsible for the collection of the ecuador pollution judgment which it is doing with local counsel in canada and other countries chevron has used at least law firms and legal personnel to fight the communities and has vowed never to pay the award even though it had promised to abide by any court ruling in ecuador when it shifted the trial there in from us federal court“to prevent any confusion going forward the fda wants ecuador’s government and the public to know that mr fajardo does not represent the organization and is not authorized to speak on its behalf” guaman added “with regard to the voluntary lifting of embargo orders against chevron only the fda has the authority to do so and in fact we consider the lifting of the previous order by mr fajardo to be illegal”when confronted by various media outlets as why he lifted the order with no public announcement fajardo claimed he was trying to protect ecuador’s government from pressure being generated by chevron ecuador’s government is represented in the matter by a prominent american law firm winston strawn for his part salazar said he was “honored” to represent the fda and that he was recruiting other litigators with significant experience to ensure that the interests of the communities and the fda were fully protected in ecuador and elsewhere given that chevron refuses to pay the ecuador judgment salazar already has been advising the fda as the organization navigates existing and potentially new enforcement actions that target chevron assets recently salazar played a critical role in helping the fda secure a private financing of the enforcement action in canada where the villagers recently secured a unanimous supreme court decision in their favorthe fda is the organization that has played a leading role in the twodecade struggle to hold chevron accountable for the dumping of billions of gallons of toxic waste in ecuador as confirmed by various courts in the countryseveral leaders of the fda along with dozens of named plaintiffs initiated the original environmental lawsuit against chevron in new york in and then sued the company under ecuador’s environmental management act in after the venue was shifted at chevron’s request to the south american nation as indicated the fda is now the sole fiduciary to implement the ecuador judgment and is entitled to a separate monetary award which is being used to finance opposition to chevron’s massive campaign to retaliate against the communities guaman emphasized that the fda will continue to coordinate with all of the affected communities to recover assets from chevron to that a comprehensive cleanup of the damage can take place while at the same time protecting the independence of the lawsuit from ecuador’s government salazar emphasized how seriously he takes his new duties “i will say that the most important role of a lawyer is to protect the interests of his clients even when powerful forces like governments and wealthy corporations have their own agendas” he said “while we respect ecuador’s government we strongly disagree with the payment to chevron which clearly violated the embargo order that was in place the fundamental interests of the communities – specifically their rights to life health care and a clean environment must always remain paramount even when in conflict with the government’s economic and political interests”in the legal case against chevron three layers of courts in ecuador found that the company deliberately dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste in the country when it operated there from to decimating indigenous groups and causing an outbreak of cancer that has killed or threatens to kill thousands of people the judgment against chevron was confirmed unanimously by ecuador’s highest court in ,

concluded an indepth waste characterization study that demonstrated that a significant portion of the waste that the nps manages nationally is brought in from outside the park – with a small range of everyday items being the biggest issue the study found plastic waste such as water bottles plastic bags nonrecyclable or compostable food packaging and paper hot cups are the main drivers of waste sent to landfills and the biggest concern in the national parksnps manages more than million pounds of waste nationally much of which is generated by serving more than million park visitors per year

issue in the parks americans can make a difference npca conducted research that included everything from analytics to dumpsterdiving and have developed a set of tips that visitors can adopt to help reduce some of the biggest contributors to landfills from national parks including paper plastics and glass“if visitors to national parks took steps to lessen their environmental footprint it would make a significant difference in addressing these waste challenges” said theresa pierno president and ceo of national parks conservation association “the actions we take now whether it’s drinking from reusable water bottles instead of buying plastic ones or taking out what you take into the park will make an impact for generations to come by working together – with parks visitors concessioners and

proven blend of specially sourced coconut fibers and cork developed after a decade of success working exclusively with organic infills in the united states greenplay® has been tested to meet or exceed the most rigorous performance safety and environmental benchmarks while proving to be the most durable organic infill available it is guaranteed to perform under warranty for as long as the synthetic turf it is inherently the safest of all alternative infills because it is natural and blended with pesticide free organic material greenplay® contains no sbr crumb rubber silica sand plastics chemicals or polymers and is completely recyclable at its end of life to be repurposed on site as a dressing for natural grass or soil greenplay® enhances a turf field to play like the best natural grass by enhancing foot stability with low energy restitution and vertical deformation it makes the playing surface safer because it is essentially nonabrasive pliable absorbs impact forces and keeps the turf temperature on par with natural grass due to its high moisture retention providing an evaporative effect as it releases the cool moisture the lower field temperatures in conjunction with the inherent low bulk density of the material will result in prolonged turf fiber life greenplay® naturally resists mold rot and fungus due to naturally occurring tanninsbrock powerbase has been the industry’s leading shock pad and drainage layer used underneath synthetic turf fields for many years powerbase has been proven to greatly reduce head injury criterion hic values and gmax of a synthetic turf surface system as compared to synthetic turf installed directly over a compacted stone base research indicates that a reduction in hic and gmax values will reduce the risk and severity of a head injury brock now introduces its gen ii powerbase pro and powerbase ysr both certified cradle to cradle™ for environmental compatibility and with standard year warranty the brock gen ii powerbase beneath the turf will provide the field with a firm consistent surface while also guaranteeing safety and stability brock international is an official educational partner of the concussion legacy foundation a bostonbased nonprofit organization founded to advance the study treatment and prevention of brain trauma in athletes and other atrisk groups “athletes tend to experience brain injuries in one of four impact areas – headtohead headtobody headtoball and headtosurface brock has taken a leadership stance in trying to prevent concussions by focusing on the playing field itself” noted chris nowinski cofounder and executive director of the sports legacy foundation “we are excited to partner with an innovative company that shares our mission to protect athletes through education programs and raising awareness” the concussion legacy foundation has determined that at least in sportsrelated concussions are the result of a head impact with the playing field surface unlike a helmet cleat or shin guard the field is the one common “equipment” used by all athletespristine natural turf grass is the benchmark for the safest highperformance playing surface turf grass is firm and stable to run on provides ideal traction and is highly resilient under bodily and head impacts consequently international performance and safety specifications for synthetic turf are modeled after values achieved on natural turf grass turf grass is not only the playing surface of choice of elite and amateur athletes alike but as compared to traditional synthetic turf has shown to produce exceptional results under impact tests to assess head injury risk research by the university of tennessee center for athletic safety has established benchmark values for the most pristine natural sports turf both bermuda grass and kentucky bluegrass usga and astm sandsoil constructions and native soil intensive testing and analysis has shown that the greenplay brock combination can provide overall safety and performance comparable to the most pristine natural turf grass all synthetic surface systems with brock and greenplay were tested utilizing a ” slit film turf according to standard protocol over concrete in a temperature controlled laboratory environment the natural turf grass surfaces from the utcas study consist of pristine test plots at optimal turf density and sandsoil moisture content all surfaces were tested with the astm head form device the procedure consisted of drop from increasing drop heights to plot hic results and determine “critical fall height” critical fall height is defined as the point at which the impact from a drop produces a head injury criterion value of critical fall height results are expressed in meters rounded down to the nearest at hic there is a risk of an ais critical head injury a “critical” head injury is characterized as loss of consciousness skull fracture neurological damage brain hemorrhage with a risk of a fatality this is obviously a threshold to be avoided as a result of a head impact with a playing surface the international rugby board mandates a minimum critical fall height of to certify its playing surfaces although this threshold is much lower than natural turf it is currently the only reference standard for synthetic turf playing surfaces additional impact tests of the surfaces were performed with the astm “gmax” method and vertical deformation a measurement of surface stiffness under the simulated impact of a running athlete these comparisons have shown that in terms of head injury risk assessment the composite synthetic turf field system of brock gen ii powerbase and greenplay® organic infill perform within the range of pristine natural turf grass and in some cases produced superior results

__label__Human-Rights  san ramon calif may  after six years as chevron ceo and chair of the board john watson has been unable to resolve major shareholder unrest over his leadership in one of its strongest rebukes to date thirty percent of chevron shareholders representing billion of assets under management sent a clear message to watson and his team on the ecuador issue your leadership has failed sponsors of the resolution contended that again the issue of the company’s ongoing contamination in ecuador and efforts by indigenous and farmer communities to enforce their billion judgment against chevron dominated the meeting humberto piaguaje secoya indigenous leaders whose community has been gravely affected by chevron’s pollution in the amazon addressed the ceo directly “mr watson stop your racism against us we are neither manipulated nor will we ever be manipulated by lawyers or anyone else as you continually repeat we are intelligent enough to think and act for ourselves and to seek justice” to which watson inexplicably responded “we are sorry that the indigenous people of ecuador have been manipulated by lawyers and by their own government”watson had absolutely no response to repeated questions about the company’s and specific criticism of his mismanagement of the issue instead he turned to a chevronproduced video released months ago alleging that the company “cleaned up its part” in ecuador unfortunately for watson amazon watch immediately responded to the video pointing out to the room “if that were true why did your own technicians find toxic contamination in on those very sites you claimed in this video to have cleaned up years prior in your own lawyers authenticated they even interviewed local residents who were still getting sick at the time from the contamination you accepted responsibility for as recently as a few months ago in your new video”while chevron’s propaganda video blames petroecuador for its own legacy of contamination in ecuador after the ecuadorian government chevron is by far the largest processor of petroecuadors oil not only is chevron refusing to clean up its legacy of contamination its deepening it by refining nearly barrels a day of oil from the amazon at the next mention of the words “amazon contamination” watson become visibly flustered and frustrated shutting off the microphone and disallowing further questions on the ecuador issue tellingly he said “i’ve been trying to answer questions on ecuador for seven years and i am not going to take any more questions” for watson who took over the reins as ceo from david o’reilly chevron’s liability on the ecuador issue is squarely on his shoulders watson was the principal architect of the merger between texaco and chevron in despite being fully aware of texaco’s toxic legacy in ecuador and ongoing litigation using obsolete technology and dumping billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into the amazon ecosystem and poisoning local communities it left behind over a thousand toxic waste pits that continue to contaminate the region the ecuadorians won a historic verdict against the company and are seeking to enforce their judgment in several countries where chevron has significant assets chevron is staring down an billion debt collection action in canada for failure to pay the ecuadorian verdict the affected communities in ecuador recently in their effort to force watson to comply with the judgment by seizing the companys assets in canada chevron has an estimated billion worth of oil fields bank accounts and refineries – or more than enough to pay the entirety of the ecuador judgment no mention was made of this liability in watson’s report to shareholders nor has the company reported it to the sec in accordance with the law adding to chevron’s problems in canada is growing solidarity between the country’s first nations and indigenous communities affected in ecuador chevron has significant upstream development projects and pipelines planned in canada some of which are on or slated for first nations’ territory“as first nations peoples of canada we stand with the affected indigenous communities in ecuador who continue their decadeslong quest for justice from chevron for its deliberate contamination of the amazon rainforest” said michelle thrush cree from treaty in alberta canada noted canadian actor and winner of a gemini award canadas highest honor for screen actorsadding to watson’s blunders as ceo chevron admits it is still paying disgraced ecuadorian exjudge alberto guerra the key witness in chevron’s retaliatory rico case who recently as part an illadvised parallel case chevron filed with the hague chevron was forced to concede that a witness who already lacked any credibility for admitting to lying and accepting numerous bribes in his past guerra “exaggerated to chevron in an attempt to improve his negotiating position” as yet watson failed to disclose these important legal developments to his shareholderswatson also faced harsh criticisms for wasting millions more shareholder funds in an outright attempt to buy local elections in richmond ca last year the company’s candidates received a thumping from grassroots richmond progressive alliance candidates and the entire debacle has made chevron a prime target for the movement to get corporate funding out of politics richmond continues its million suit against chevron for the refinery fire which sent people to the hospitalin fact chevron faced related to climate change in addition to appointing a board member with environmental expertise chevron leadership remains completely divorced from reality in insisting that by a full percent of the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and gas despite the clear climate science about the dangers of methane emissions watson said that the company would address climate issues primarily via the “miracle of hydraulic fracturing” watson claimed chevron “does not disagree” with the paris climate accord but accepts none of the policies intended to implement it“it’s astonishing that john watson still has a job under his leadership or lack thereof chevron’s liabilities have snowballed its brand has taken a beating and any lingering idea that chevron had any dedication to environmental or social responsibility has been eviscerated” said paul paz y miño “poisoning

the same time we will improve the lives of military families and better the overall health of our allvolunteer armed forces”congressman sanford bishop cochair of the congressional military family caucus joined blue star families in announcing the release of the study “as this very relevant and timely report suggests the inability of military spouses to find and maintain meaningful employment not only has a direct impact on the readiness of the force but also represents a larger societal cost absorbed primarily by the federal government” said congressman bishop “the report’s findings are simply alarming for military families and for our nation we must do more to support our military spouses in our work force”in a bipartisan display of support house republican conference chair cathy

said “i look forward to working with rep bishop and our counterparts in the senate military family caucus to make sure they do”the blue star families study also explored the personal consequences of military spouse employment challenges which include negative effects on emotional wellbeing and health“the families and spouses of our active military are the cornerstone of their support network and it’s important to look at how military lifestyles impact the spouses’ wellbeing” said john damonti president of the bristolmyers squibb foundation the sponsor of the study “we are proud to support the work of blue star families in shining a light on this important issue”blue star families is calling on public and private sector leaders to take action “we are confident that the country can tackle this challenge in the same way we came together to reduce veteran unemployment several years ago” rothdouquet stated “to ensure military households have a fair shot at achieving economic security we need the involvement of all americans” starbucks a recognized leader on veteran employment issues has committed to more closely examine this issue and increase its hiring of military spouses “spouses are the backbone of military families and invaluably influence and contribute to the lives of veterans and active duty service members” said john kelly senior vice president of global responsibility

__label__Renewable-&-Alternative-Energy __label__Environment fredericia denmark jul  the cost of black energy has now got green competition solar power and wind are already cheaper than fossil alternatives and according to dong energy offshore wind must follow the same development dong energy aims to make green energy from offshore wind turbines at least as cheap as black energy from fossil fuels in ten years the danish energy company which is among the global leaders within offshore wind power gives five specific examples of how that is going to happenthe larger the wind turbines are the more energy they produce each time they rotate this means that we can harness more offshore wind in a more costeffective manner since when dong energy built the worlds first offshore wind farm vindeby off the coast of denmark wind turbines have grown almost fourfold in size back then the wind turbines had a height of metres an equivalent rotor span and a capacity of by comparison dong energy will build an offshore wind farm in the uk next year with tall wind turbines with a rotor span of metres and a capacity of this rotor span more or less corresponds to the diameter of the colosseum in romeit requires solid steel foundations to anchor offshore wind turbines safely in the seabed but steel is expensive therefore good savings can be made if the foundations can be made smaller in cooperation with a number of business partners dong energy has completed the research project pisa pile soil analysis and tested different pile foundations in different soil conditions the study of the piles which varied in size type and amount of steel gave an interesting resultsays jesper skov gretlund project manager in dong energys research development department building offshore wind farms costs money and the same goes for service and maintenance of the wind farms once they have been constructed here too dong energy works to reduce costs for example new technology has made it easier and cheaper to inspect offshore wind turbines previously specially trained technicians had to crawl out onto each blade and examine each turbine in detail to see if they were damaged or defective it was a very demanding and hazardous work which only made it possible to inspect one single wind turbine per day today dong energy has developed a method using stateoftheart equipment to take pictures of the wind turbine blades from a distancejesper skov gretlund explains the cost savings are significant on the one hand the method requires far less resources and on the other hand the inspection is much faster previously wind turbines had to be put at a standstill for an entire day now a couple of hours out of operation gives enough time to perform the inspection normally it is not an advantage to sleep at work but with the new sovs service operation vessels a longer stay offshore will help reduce the costs for transport and nonproductive man hoursbefore technicians were transfered back and forth to the offshore wind farms every day it created disturbances in the work process and cost a lot of transport time to optimise the work process dong energy has recently invested in two sovs which in addition to the crew cabins can accommodate wind turbine technicians the vessels sail out to the wind farms where they drop anchor and function as a base for the technicians the vessels are a kind of floating hotels where the technicians eat sleep and relax close to their temporary workplace at sea according to dong energy standardisation is a fifth and decisive factor that will make green offshore wind power cheaper than black energysays jesper skov gretlundin short it is about constructing offshore wind farms in areas where the soil and wind conditions are similar to those the company is already familiar with also the wind turbines are to an increasingly larger extent built with standardised components which are produced by suppliers in a competitive market in this way the cost of spare parts and service is brought down exactly as we know it from car repair shops the plan to generate green energy from offshore wind power at the same cost as black within the next decade is ambitious but not unrealistic in dong energy set a target of reducing costs for the construction of offshore wind farms by by and the company is well on the way to reaching this target but according to jesper skov gretlund there are many factors which are decisive in realising this projectjesper gretlund concluded ,

__label__Environment  new york   pour a little maple syrup from quebec on your pancakes or in your coffee contribute to the preservation of ecosystem goods and services for our planet that’s a lot to accomplish before breakfast is done a recent study by groupe agéco and the reveals that forests in quebec currently in use for the production of maple goods are ecological powerhouses these forests generally protected under quebec law provide million usd billion canadian dollars in ecosystem services that are “useful and essential to human wellbeing and do not in many cases have any manmade substitute” the study outlines the benefits of the maple syrupproducing forests in three broad categories following recognized international approaches maple forests producing maple syrup store metric tons of carbon each year this is the equivalent of offsetting the carbon emissions from vehicles in a year or of the vehicles in new york city in comparison the maple syrup production packaging and distribution processes release metric tons per year the evaluation of ecosystem goods and services is an innovative new approach thats being adopted more and more around the world the methodologies we used are recognized by the international scientific community they attribute a monetary value to services rendered by nature itself value which is often taken for granted said groupe agéco associate and studycoauthor jeanpierre revéret the federation of quebec maple syrup producers has become a pioneer in its usage here in quebec by applying it to the maple products sectormany people worldwide choose maple syrup from quebec maple for its wonderful taste nutritional value and sweetening capacity in the united states the uk quebec and japan alone million households are consuming maple syrup from quebec it meets the needs of conscious consumers demanding natural ecofriendly products – and the more they eat the more benefits they stimulate once a maple tree is used for maple syrup production it is generally protected by quebec law through a number of provisions and cannot be cut down “if you consider that maple trees now in production are protected by quebec’s and those still untapped are sure to offer economic benefits government protection of the maple forests is surely justified the more you buy maple products from quebec the more you contribute to the protection of quebec’s maple forests and the ecosystem services they provide to the benefit of us all” said serge beaulieu president of the federation of quebec maple syrup producers fpaq there are at least million untapped maple trees in quebec right now the total economic value of the entire maple forest is billion usd billion canadian dollars and it offsets the carbon emissions from vehicles each year or onethird of the vehicles in new york city however that value is not guaranteed to last until the million untapped trees are put into production they are generally not under protection and could be cut down at any time depriving current and future generations of the ecological benefits they providewhen one person per household uses one teaspoon of maple syrup or maple sugar each day instead of another sweetener two new maple trees go into production – and under protection” said geneviève c béland fpaq director of promotion innovation and market development “if many people made the switch to maple large areas of forest would be protected providing more benefits and conserving a proud heritage to serve future generations”the study was conducted by groupe agéco a consulting firm specializing in corporate responsibility and economic studies particularly in the food sectorthe identification of ecosystem services and the value of goods and services put forward in this project are based on an innovative approach taken from the millennium ecosystem assessment mea it was initiated in by the united nations and involved the work of more than experts from countries this research was subsequently bolstered by other efforts among which we note the international initiative undertaken in by the environment ministers the economics of ecosystem and biodiversity teeb since then the approach has been applied increasingly by entities such as municipalities governments ngos and businesses in order to include the value of ecosystem services in decisionmaking for a more informed management of natural capitalsince fpaq has pursued its mission of defending and promoting the economic social and moral interests of maple enterprises in quebec men and women working together to

saidchevron operated in ecuador under the texaco brand from to leaving behind an environmental and public health catastrophe called the amazon chernobyl by locals the pollution has devastated dozens of indigenous and farmer communities and cost chevron an estimated billion in legal and other fees while the companys reputation has been and good government groupsa top chevron official has said the company would fight the indigenous groups until hell freezes over and then fight it out on the ice although chevron insisted for years that the environmental claims be heard in ecuador and had accepted jurisdiction there the company later sold all of its assets in the country and now refuses to pay the judgmentthe indigenous groups last year in their effort to force watson to comply with the judgment by seizing the companys assets in canada chevron has an estimated billion worth of oil fields bank accounts and refineries – or more than enough to pay the entirety of the ecuador judgment watson and his chief lawyer r hewitt pate have tried to argue that company assets in canada should be off limits to the ecuadorians because they are held by a whollyowned subsidiarychevron also faces mounting pressure from a growing international movement of communities from europe and latin america who have banded together to oppose the companys substandard environmental practices this years action called the antichevron day will take place from may and will include online and live activities in several countries that will denounce chevrons environmental and human rights violations see for backgroundapart from pressure from the amazonian communities some of chevrons own shareholders are also demanding that watson – who in personally earned million despite a drop in company revenue – comply immediately with the ecuador court judgment and clean up the estimated toxic waste pits and other pollution it left behind when it departed the south american nation in this year filed a shareholder resolution see p of that sharply rebukes watson for his mishandling of the ecuador litigation chevron has used to fight the indigenous groups but it continues to suffer courtroom setbackseighteen consecutive appellate judges in ecuador and canada have now ruled against chevron in a case that is fast becoming a potential for the company the supreme courts of both ecuador and canada have unanimously ruled against chevron another us appellate court unanimously ruled against the company when it tried to use a us trial judge to block enforcement of the ecuador judgment anywhere in the worldthe newground resolution calls for chevron to make it easier to hold special meetings given that watsons management team has mishandled a number of issues in ways that significantly increase both risks and costs to shareholders the most pressing of these issues is the ongoing legal effort by communities in ecuador to enforce a billion ecuadorian judgment for oil pollution the judgment is now roughly billion because of statutory interestnewground asserts that under watsons leadership chevron has yet to properly report these risks in either public filings or statements to shareholders as a result investors requested on several occasions that the us securities and exchange commission investigate whether chevron had violated securities laws by misrepresenting or materially omitting information relevant to the ecuador liabilitychevron also faces several other shareholder resolutions – one sponsored by the union of concerned scientists – that suggest the company has fallen well behind its industry peers in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the challenges of climate change one such resolution calls on the company to produce reports establishing companywide goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions another asks for a change in dividend policy given that the global shift away from fossil fuels will likely lead to billions of dollars of stranded assets in the form of oil reserves watson and chevrons board oppose all of the climate change resolutionspiaguajes trip being made on behalf of dozens of indigenous and farmer communities devastated by chevrons pollution will culminate in an expected facetoface showdown with watson on may at company headquarters near san francisco piaguaje will confront watson with the extensive evidence of the companys toxic dumping relied on by the judgmentchevron continues to get hit hard on the ecuador issue several months ago chevrons star witness admitted lying under oath after being paid more than million by the company moved to the united states and coached for consecutive days by chevron lawyers before being allowed to testify separately amazon watch recently disclosed a chevron whistleblower showing company scientists trying to fraudulently hide extensive evidence of oil pollution from the ecuador court the video has been seen millions of times on the internetpiaguaje and other ecuadorian rainforest leaders – including goldman environmental prize winners and – have been pressuring watson for years to pay the pollution liability so their ancestral lands can be remediated disease rates have skyrocketed in the affected area groundwater has been contaminated and there is virtually no clean water for tens of thousands of people piaguajes secoya community has seen its culture decimated because of a lack of fresh water and clean food according to evidence in the caseour leaders plan to confront mr watson with judgments from multiple courts mandating the company pay its pollution bill to the people of ecuador said piaguaje mr watson needs to accept responsibility for chevrons environmental crimes in ecuador apologize to the companys victims and abide by court orders that compensation be paiduntil he abides by the rule of law mr watson and chevrons board members will be considered by us to be fugitives from justice subject to arrest for crimes against humanity under principles of universal jurisdiction he addedin previous shareholder meetings chevrons management has suffered a series of sharp rebukes over its ecuador liability one resolution calling on watson to separate the positions of chairman and ceo – widely considered a corporate governance anachronism – from all company shareholders normally any shareholder resolution that receives more than support is considered successfulin addition in several of chevrons institutional shareholders with more than billion in assets under management sent watson the ecuador case amazon watch also organized blasting the company for trying to silence its critics over the ecuador issuein failing to negotiate a reasonable settlement prior to the ecuadorian courts ruling against the company we believe that chevrons board of directors and management displayed poor judgment that has exposed the corporation to a substantial financial liability and risk to its operations said the investor letterus congressman james mcgovern dma who visited the affected area in also sent describing the horrid living conditions caused by chevrons dumping practices the company has also been criticized for trying in canada for trying to intimidate lawyers and scientists for the villagers under racketeering laws and for trying to to more than journalists bloggers and even some of its own shareholders who have questioned management in his first year as ceo watson lost his cool at the shareholder meeting and who had challenged him over ecuadordeepak gupta a prominent us appellate lawyer who represents us attorney steven donziger the main target of chevrons retaliation campaign recent called chevrons litigation strategy an intimidation model in an chevron faces a critical court hearing in canada in september that could knock out most of the companys case that it plans to use to evade enforcement of the judgmentthe damage is so extensive that it is unclear whether the full amount of the judgment would be sufficient for a comprehensive cleanup piaguaje said the humanitarian crisis in our communities due to chevrons pollution is dire and getting worse,

 __label__Philanthropy-&-Corporate-Contributions orlando fla feb  most programs at the top of the list of the nation’s largest peertopeer fundraising campaigns are raising substantially less money for their organizations than they were a decade agobut those losses are being more than eclipsed by a growing cadre of smaller but substantial fastgrowing peertopeer efforts a new study shows looking back at what were america’s five largest peertopeer fundraising programs in four have experienced precipitous drops in revenues according to the the annual report ranking the country’s largest peertopeer fundraising programsthose four programs —american cancer society’s relay for life leukemia lymphoma society’s team in training march of dimes’ march for babies and susan g komen for the cure’s komen — collectively raised million in million less than they had raised in as those campaigns have struggled a new wave of rapidly expanding programs has emergednine of the programs on the thirty list have seen their revenues more than double during the past decade two others — memorial sloankettering cancer center’s cycle for survival and the bicycling event pelotonia — are so new they didn’t even exist when the thirty was created years ago “this firstever review of campaigns over a period shows just how much the peertopeer landscape has changed over the past decade” said david hessekiel president of the peertopeer professional forum which authors the annual survey “while a handful of brandname programs have struggled to keep pace with their prior results many highly successful campaigns have emerged as a result more charities than ever are seeing significant revenues from peertopeer fundraising” peertopeer fundraising is the practice of having a nonprofit’s supporters reach out to their friends family members and colleagues for donations often through participation in walks and ridescollectively revenues from the largest peertopeer fundraising programs totaled billion in — up a modest percent over the billion reported by these groups in when the totals for the four programs near the top of the list are excluded the figures tell a much different storythe remaining programs on the top list collectively raised billion in up percent over the million raised by that pool of programs in that group are a number of campaigns that have boasted substantial increases in the past decade that diverse group includes the american foundation for suicide prevention’s out of the darkness community walks which grew more than tenfold — from million in to million in alsacst jude children’s research hospital’s st jude heroes which has increased its fundraising total by percent during the past decade to million st baldrick’s foundation’s headshaving events which raised million in up percent from the million the events raised a decade ago american diabetes association’s tour de cure which brought in more than million in up percent from the alzheimer’s association’s

nearly millionnotable among these fastgrowing programs are the diverse formats that they employ — running the gamut of traditional walk campaigns singleday and multicity cycling events endurance campaigns and doityourself or independent programs“we’ve seen a true democratization of peertopeer where your success isn’t driven by the type of event you run but rather your ability to produce excellent experiences for volunteer fundraisers” hessekiel said “you no longer have to be among the largest or most established organizations to raise money through peertopeer”some longrunning programs are continuing to show their mettle most notably american heart association’s heart walk which ranked no on the list with million up percent from the heart walk founded in is one of the longest running peertopeer campaigns in the nation and has seen its fundraising totals increase by percent over the past decadeamerican heart association also has a healthy longrunning campaign that engages youth in peertopeer fundraising by shooting hoops or jumping rope the youth campaign raised nearly million in a percent increase from “while it’s easy to look at the older and larger programs and see a decline several of these programs have shown very strong growth” said jeff shuck ceo of plenty a consulting company and sponsor of the peertopeer thirty “the teams working on those programs will tell you that there’s not one magic solution rather a reengineering of every aspect of the program and how it’s managed”substantial revenue declines by some major programs brought the top tally

__label__Activism __label__Environment quito ecuador mar  chevron has decided to abandon the last legitimate legal challenge to its billion pollution liability in ecuador dealing yet another blow to the company’s strategy to evade a cleanup of billions of gallons of toxic waste that courts found were deliberately dumped into the country’s rainforestchevron ceo john watson’s decision to give up a critical ecuadorian law claim – available under the countrys collusion prosecution act cpa follows a series of devastating legal setbacks for chevron including defeats before separate appellate judges in ecuador and canada it also represents a major step forward for rainforest villagers as they try to seize chevron’s assets in canada and brazil to pay for a cleanup of into the rivers and streams of their ancestral lands decimating indigenous groups and causing an leaders of the affected communities who have fought chevron’s scorchedearth litigation strategy for two decades assert the company abandoned the cpa claim because it knew it would lose on the merits “this is another example of chevron bailing out of any court where it knows its incredibly weak evidence will not carry the day” said luis yanza and the representative of the amazon defense coalition the group representing the indigenous and farmer communities who won the judgmentpaul paz y miño a director with the environmental group characterized chevrons decision as a major victory for the affected communities“it is obvious that chevron believes that its legal position in the ecuador case is weakening” said paz y miño who works with the rainforest communities to hold chevron accountable “watson needs to stop the greenwashing and comply with the law so vulnerable indigenous communities can receive immediate relief to stave off more cancer deaths and possible extinction”although chevron’s abandoned legal claim is technical in nature it is hugely significant in terms of the overall dynamics of the case lawyers for the company recently let lapse a fiveyear deadline that allows the losing party in an ecuadorian civil case to use the cpa to file a separate lawsuit to reverse a judgment on the grounds that it was obtained illegally the cpa allows a collateral claim similar to a habeas corpus proceeding in the united states for a person trying to overturn a conviction experts believe the cpa is tailormade for procedural claims like those chevron has made against the environmental judgment a win by chevron on the cpa claim in theory would erase all of the companys liabilitychevron’s abandonment of the cpa claim follows the almost total collapse in recent months of its evidence and the disclosure of an showing company technicians hatching an elaborate plot to try to hide oil field pollution from ecuador’s courtschevron’s star witness alberto guerra admitted under oath earlier this year and testified falsely in a us federal court after being coached for days by company lawyers separately a forensic computer analysis demanded by chevron ended up the judgment was “ghostwritten” by the plaintiffs and led to charges the company before a us federal judge the forensic report proved the trial judge wrote the judgment on his computer saving it in a word document timesin canada where courts are considering the seizure of chevron’s assets the abandonment of the cpa claim likely will be viewed with disfavor and will prompt more scrutiny of the company’s flawed evidence said aaron page a usbased lawyer for the villagers “chevron’s failure to pursue the cpa claim is surely to be seen by enforcement courts as another flagrant example of the company’s bad faith” said pagein a separate international arbitration action brought by chevron against ecuador’s government – an attempt by the company to obtain a taxpayerfunded bailout in ecuador of its pollution liability the failure to file the cpa claim could in effect nullify the oil giant’s entire case in that matter a panel of private lawyers recently rejected chevron’s main defense that a remediation agreement in the absolved it of responsibility for the cleanupunder international law governing the arbitration proceeding the party bringing the claim chevron is required to exhaust all local remedies in ecuador – including use of the cpa before being allowed to obtain relief chevrons decision therefore could be fatal to its plan to shift the pollution liability to ecuador’s government “chevron’s failure to exhaust the remedies available to it … renders its denial of justice claim deficient as a matter of international law” said ecuador’s government in a recent submission to the arbitrators for detailed background on how chevron is faltering in the arbitration see this chevron has had a terrible run of late in the case which the villagers filed in us federal court in at the time chevron praised ecuador’s judicial system and agreed to accept jurisdiction in the south american nation it also promised to abide by any adverse judgment that might issue as a result of chevrons commitments a us judge sent the case to ecuador for trial in the against chevron mounted in the ensuing trial the company stripped its remaining assets from ecuador in anticipation of losing the case chevron later was found liable at the trial level and before two separate appellate courts including the countrys highest court in all separate appellate judges in ecuador canada and the united states have issued unanimous opinions against chevron in the last few yearsthose rulings include a in by ecuador’s supreme court affirming the environmental judgment and denying chevron’s attempt to block the collection action three other intermediate appellate panels – one in canada one in new york and one in ecuador each ruled unanimously in favor of the villagers in the meantime interest is running on the judgment at an estimated million annuallythe canada supreme court decision – in a country where chevron has an estimated billion worth of assets – has for the oil giant chevron and its canadian subsidiary have hired four law firms to defend the asset collection action and overall the company has used worldwide on the case considered by many to be one of the most significant corporate accountability battles everchevron has openly engaged in an abusive against the villagers trying to inundate courts with frivolous motions and at one point threatening a trial judge in ecuador with jail time if he did not throw out the case ceo watson’s legal team has repeatedly promised that chevron will fight the case “until hell freezes over and then fight it out on the ice” chevron’s decision to abandon the cpa claim is not the first time the company has used the trick of bailing out of a court case at the last minute to avoid an embarrassing loss in after years of litigation chevron suddenly withdrew a key argument it was using in us federal court over a purported remediation in ecuador after the judge leonard b sand indicated that he thought the companys position was meritless chevron later rolled out the same discredited argument the us judge found unconvincing to fuel years of additional litigation in the aforementioned international arbitration dispute whose panel also ultimately rejected the same argument that process forced ecuador’s government to spend years of effort and tens of millions of dollars in legal feesin chevron suddenly abandoned a billion money damages claim against the villagers on the eve of its when it concluded a jury of impartial fact finders might rule against it the dropping of the damages claim allowed the companys favored us judge lewis a kaplan to decide the case alone kaplan refused to admit any evidence of chevrons wrongdoing in ecuador repeatedly disparaged the villagers and their counsel in open court and failed to disclose that he held personal chevron later in that case according to court filingskaplans decision in favor of chevron resulted from a “farcicial” proceeding and has no impact on any of the enforcement actions said page it is currently under appeal before the same federal court in new york

__label__Activism __label__Environment new york dec  hit hard by a series of courtroom setbacks related to its billion ecuador pollution liability chevron’s top lawyer r hewitt pate is again misleading the financial markets by falsely claiming that a small default judgment the company obtained in the tiny protectorate of gibraltar is a major victory against indigenous villagers according to representatives of the rainforest communitiesthe chevron default judgment in gibraltar to cover the legal fees of roughly corporate defense lawyers – some of whom billed chevron as much as per hour is “worthless” in that it is against a dormant investment vehicle that has no money said steven donziger a us advisor to the indigenous communities that won the underlying environmental judgment the amount of the gibraltar judgment is million or less than one percent of what the company owes for an environmental cleanup in ecuador where courts found it responsible for discharging billions of gallons of toxic waste into streams and rivers in the and “chevron will not and indeed should not ever collect the first penny of an illusory judgment in gibraltar which is part of the company’s strategy to evade its legal obligations to the many thousands of people who face lifethreatening harm in ecuador” said donzigergibraltar a british territory of only square miles connected to spain on the southern tip of the iberian peninsula has a population of only gibraltar has only four trial judges while its tiny airport landing strip doubles as the country’s main road the territory is considered an outdated colonial relic from the british empire gibraltar in it entirety is far smaller than the rural town of ocala in north florida evidence of how desperate chevron general counsel pate is to justify the company’s failed litigation strategy said donziger “pate forum shopped the world to extract a judgment from an irrelevant jurisdiction that commands no respect on the global stage in a case that was understandably and quite properly never defended on the merits because it does not matter” donziger said “the gibraltar judgment has zero value to chevron other than as a public relations stunt to distract attention from its growing financial risk due to advances in enforcement actions targeting company assets in canada and elsewhere” for background on chevron’s deception in gibraltar see donziger criticized pate for distributing this week where he suggested that the default judgment from the “supreme court” of gibraltar – which is actually a trial court with the judgment signed by only one of the four judges – represents a major victory for the oil giant ecuador’s highest court unanimously confirmed the billion judgment against chevron in with interest the judgment is now worth slightly more than billion donziger said pate’s latest press release about the gibraltar judgment contains other misleading assertions and omits critical facts that the company’s shareholders should note as follows under pate’s watch chevron recently suffered three major setbacks in the pollution case pate was dealt a major setback when three layers of courts in ecuador found chevron deliberately dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste when it operated under the texaco brand in the south american nation from to the dumping decimated indigenous groups and caused an that has killed or threatens to kill thousands of forest inhabitants in september of this year the a chevron attempt to block the villagers from enforcing their judgment against the company’s assets in that country chevron has an estimated billion worth of oil fields refineries and properties in canada argument on the case is slated to begin march in torontomore recently media outlets see and reported that chevron’s discredited star witness alberto guerra admitted lying on the stand and falsifying evidence after he had been paid million by the company and moved with several family members from ecuador to the united states chevron lawyers coached guerra for days before he testified untruthfully in the company’s retaliatory “racketeering” case without guerra’s testimony being seen as credible chevron stands little chance of surviving the enforcement action in canada said donziger “pate is hurting because he staked almost all of chevron’s defense on a completely discredited witness who has admitted to lying repeatedly” donziger saidfor years donziger himself has been the main target of an avowed chevron demonization campaign designed to distract attention from the company’s misconduct in ecuador for donziger’s take on chevron’s efforts to corrupt the ecuador trial and present false evidence see this and filed against the companypate from chevron also has a long history of trying to mislead shareholders on behalf of company management as explains chevron has used roughly against the villagers and their lawyers under pate’s watch chevron also by some of its own shareholders for failing to fully disclose the material risk from its ecuador liability to the securities and exchange commission as required by laweven though it insisted the trial be held in ecuador chevron has vowed never to pay the judgment a company spokesman said chevron will litigate against the villagers until “hell freezes over” and then “fight it out on the ice” a chevron lobbyist also was quoted in newsweek saying in reference to the case “we can’t let little countries screw around with big companies”donziger also criticized pate for the subtle racism in chevron’s strategy to target the lawyers for the villagers to distract attention from the company’s liability“pate and his colleagues in chevron act as if no indigenous person from ecuador’s rainforest has either volition or intelligence” he said “they seem to believe the villagers are simply dumb people manipulated by outsiders i understand this mentality because that’s how texaco viewed the ecuadorian people when it deliberately destroyed their lands and waterways“today that approach reeks of racism it is also based on patently false assumptions as anybody can see by simply talking to the who have battled chevron so successfully for years all of the individual community leaders are powerful highly intelligent and in many ways far more sophisticated than pate or any of chevron’s highpriced lawyers”,

microsoft a carbon fee may help speak in terms of money ie a tax instead of carbon this could be the key to engaging a company’s business leaders such as the chief financial officer we’re committed to continued involvement with the un global compact active participation in green building councils around the world a longerterm collaboration with the world economic forum where our ceo has been actively engaged and steady interest as a business network member in the international integrated reporting council iirc which seeks to align capital allocation and corporate behavior to wider goals of financial stability and sustainable development to show our support for a positive outcome we joined the initiative and the nazca we also used our time in paris to better understand the vast array of external organizations that are driving forward climate changes actions both within our industry and more broadly as encouraged by our ceo this will help jll carefully review our climate change partnerships so that we are involved in the most focused and relevant way possible this is especially important considering how the conversation on climate change has significantly advanced in the last few years since jll has recognized the impact of ghg emissions and committed to helping our clients address energy and sustainability in their real estate over time we have also recognized that we cannot credibly offer these services without doing the same in our own operationsas a result we set targets in for jll offices to reduce our own environmental footprint our latest has details on these targets and our progress cop has spurred jll to consider how we can reset our targets according to a longer timeframe and based on climate change science we had considered this approach in and the climate change agreement provides extra impetus to raise our ambitious goals this reminds me of a powerful theme from cop the thresholds are continually getting higher and higher let’s take a simple example based on company scores in initiatives such as the dow jones sustainability index or cdp formerly carbon disclosure project companies may score x in year then in year even though improvement has been shown in year the market is actually starting to require means expectations are higher over a shorter duration companies that do not innovate and that cannot change will lose the race it’s great to see that the climate change agreement – and general tone of the conference – was that we’re all expecting more from one another and that climate change is here to stay ahead of the conference jll’s ceo sent a note to all staff worldwide which was then followed shortly by a note from me and dan to jll’s internal sustainability stakeholders the main aim of these notes was to make the firm’s presence at cop known and it has started a great dialogue in many different directions about jll’s role in advancing climate change it’s terrific to see that the momentum and positivity from paris carry over into conversations within jll as well we certainly believe the conference outcomes are consistent with our longterm sustainability strategy and our immediate plans include several briefings with jll leadership to provide our cop observations we will also issue internal guidance that ensures our client account managers understand what cop means for their clients across all sectorswe see these developments as the perfect springboard to engage our clients and supply chain partners further extending our influence beyond our business to create permanent sustainable behavioral changeultimately our involvement in cop – and even more so the actions that we take following the climate change agreement – will help ensure we have a sustainable enterprise that clients investors and employees can rely on for the long term about jll’s sarah nicholls sarah nicholls is jll’s global corporate sustainability gcs team leader the gcs team focuses primarily on the

__label__Environment  new york jan  in chevron faces a potential litigation catastrophe over its billion “amazon chernobyl” pollution liability as rainforest villagers step up efforts to force company assets into receivership to pay for a courtordered cleanup of what experts consider to be one of the worst oilrelated environmental disasters in historyyears of scorchedearth litigation against the villagers employed by chevron ceo john watson not only has failed to derail the case despite an estimated billion in costs to the company but has created even more severe tests for the oil giant in the coming year among them“all told was a disastrous year for chevron in the ecuador pollution case and might be even more challenging for the company as it tries to dig out of its everdeeper hole” said paul paz y mino a director with the environmental group that for years has been battling the oil giant over its toxic dumping in ecuadorthe adverse court decisions against chevron combined with the unraveling of chevron’s star witness could lead to a “litigation catastrophe” for the company in canada said paz y mino chevron maintains an estimated billion in assets in the country that the villagers are trying to seize“make no mistake about it chevron is now moving backwards in its abusive campaign to evade the ecuador judgment despite spending massive sums of shareholder money on an unethical illegal devious and ultimately futile jurisdictional shell game” said paz y mino “rather than clean up the toxic waste his company dumped ceo john watson instead continues to wage war on the very people he poisoned” a goldman prize winner and a leader of the dozens of communities that won the judgment said “we have won the litigation and held chevron accountable we are now making huge progress toward collecting the judgment against a company that is on the run from the law we hope that will be the year that courts finally force chevron to comply with its legal obligations”here is a summary of some of the major challenges facing chevron in from the ecuador judgment as the company continues its attacks on rainforest villagers in the canada supreme court ruled that the villagers could try to seize company assets to enforce their judgment chevron has an estimated billion of oil fields refineries office buildings and other properties in the country for background on chevron’s difficulties in canada see increasingly desperate and with narrowing options chevron enlisted canadian national and to defend the company’s arguments a by leading computer expert j christopher racich definitively proves that chevron’s claim the judgment was “ghostwritten” by the plaintiffs is not only untrue but was fabricated by company lawyers to block the villagers from enforcing their judgment the chevron witness alberto guerra admitted to after being coached for days by chevron lawyers and paid at least million by the company prosecutors in ecuador want to pursue guerra on perjury charges which explains why chevron moved him and his family to an undisclosed location in the us under company protection it also was revealed that of guerra as part of a package of benefits given in exchange for his testimony for the courthouse news story on guerra’s lying see watson is dealing with over his mishandling of the ecuador litigation he faces yet another shareholder resolution in taking him to task over his bungling of the litigation despite historically unprecedented expenditures to fund at least to fight the villagers also continuein a shareholder resolution challenging the company’s scorchedearth strategy on the ecuador case received whopping support – of all shares representing billion of market value at the company’s annual meeting normally any shareholder resolution that garners more than support is considered successful the ecuadorrelated resolution was the fourth in recent years put forward by shareholders that received at least support humberto piaguaje a leader of ecuador’s secoya nationality and a representative of the communities affected by the pollution confronted watson directly at the chevron annual meeting caused by the company’s deliberate dumping of toxic waste in the meantime and human rights groups from around the world have filed “friend of the court” briefs in the us and canada backing the affected communities aw already organized human rights and environmental organizations – including amnesty international friends of the earth and the sierra club for the company’s retaliatory litigation strategy the group is planning to back a formal complaint to the department of justice and other legal authorities over evidence that chevron tried to bribe witnesses including the trial judge who ruled against the companyamazon watch also reports it has received significant renewed financial support from a number of donors despite chevron’s unethical efforts to pressure the organization’s funders to back away from the ecuador campaign amazon watch recently released a series of chevron whistleblower videos showing company scientists engaged in an elaborate ruse to hide the company’s contamination from the court during the trial there see to watch the tapes and to read a news story about it more than two million people have viewed the tapes the company will be under pressure to refute evidence that it tried to use its paid witness guerra to offer a starter bribe payment of million to the trial judge in ecuador who ruled against the company chevron used miamibased lawyer andres rivero who received at least million in fees from the company to try to set up the bribe which appears to violate the foreign corrupt practices act watson continues to deal with fallout from a devastating decision by three private arbitrators who threw out the company’s claim that it had “remediated” the pollution problem in the the decision came in collateral attack filed by chevron against ecuador’s government where the company is seeking a taxpayerfunded bailout of its pollution liability chevron’s general counsel former bush administration official r hewitt pate – has been accused of market manipulation after exaggerating the significance of an illusory default judgment obtained in the tiny protectorate of gibraltar against a company set up by the villagers to protect the proceeds of their judgment for background on pate’s misleading statements see for an earlier example of pate trying to bamboozle the markets see the same trial practice group that represents chevron in trying to undermine the ecuador judgment – led by the controversial lawyer randy mastro – recently was for ethical lapses in an internal investigation of new jersey governor chris christie over the closing of access lanes to the george washington bridge that decision came after another gdc lawyer on behalf of a client the same allegation the villagers have leveled at the firm for allowing guerra to present false witness testimony for background on more gdc ethical lapses in the chevron case see and chevron’s – in reality a farcical show trial conducted by a deeply arrogant us judge who deemed ecuador’s entire judiciary unworthy of international respect – continues to lack relevance aside from guerra’s admissions that he lied on the stand a new york appellate court harshly criticized chevron’s lead lawyer during oral argument in a pending appeal although it will not affect enforcement actions targeting chevron assets a second adverse appellate decision against chevron in that case could deal a further blow to the company’s public relations narrativefinally chevron’s ongoing demonization campaign targeting lawyers for the villagers with defamation and espionage failed to accomplish its goal of blocking the case the main target of that campaign – new york attorney – blasted the company in a while he and his clients continued to receive support from scholars and civil society groups around the worlddonziger said he was concerned that watson has invested so much in chevron’s strategy that he has left the company with no coherent exit strategy “mr watson has marched the company so far out onto a limb it appears there is no longer a viable path to turn back without watson himself losing face and possibly his job” said donziger “watson appears to be waging a sort of personal crusade against the villagers and their lawyers “that’s not an appropriate role for a ceo and in our view reflects a severe corporate governance flaw in chevron that runs counter to shareholder interests chevron should comply with the law and pay the ecuador judgment forthwith”,

__label__Activism __label__Environment geneva jan  ecuadorian indigenous villagers who braved death threats in their battle with chevron have teamed up with a leading international organization block the oil giant from continuing an intimidation campaign targeting the human rights advocates who obtained a legallybinding billion environmental pollution judgment against the companychevron’s strategy of using espionage and threats to target the villagers and their lawyers as retaliation for winning the historic judgment violates international human rights law and is part of a wellfinanced campaign by the oil giant to obtain impunity for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into the forest said representatives of the villagers in to the international body seeking an investigation chevron’s dumping decimated indigenous groups and caused an killing or threatening to kill thousands of rainforest inhabitants according to the in ecuador ecuador’s supreme court in in a decision that meticulously documented the presence of lifethreatening toxins at hundreds of abandoned chevron well sites in the jungle the villagers first filed their claims in in new york but the case was shifted at chevron’s request to ecuador where the company accepted jurisdiction after chevron lost the case in ecuador – largely based on its own evidence – the company refused to pay the judgment with its lead lawyer vowing to fight the villagers “until hell freezes over” and beyond chevron also did nothing when lawyers for the communities including prominent ecuadorian human rights advocates alejandro ponce villacis and pablo fajardo mendoza and other forms of harassment during the litigation from the villagers was addressed to a french national who is the special rapporteur at the united nations charged with protecting human rights defenders human rights defenders are individuals and organizations that fight to protect internationally recognized human rights including the rights of people harmed by the dumping of toxic waste into the environmentchevron’s “strategy subjects the villagers to severe intimidation physical and emotional harassment damage to reputation financial burden to the point of bankruptcy and even fear of trumpedup penal consequences” said the letter which was signed by melik ozden director of a wellknown genevabased development organization founded in which has official consultative status with the united nations“we submit that your office has a duty to remind the countries involved that international human rights law obliges them to ensure that their systems of justice have safeguards sufficient to prevent powerful actors like multinational corporations from manipulating court processes in order to intimidate or retaliate against opponents at the cost of freedom of expression and other human rights” said the letteraaron page a human rights defender and lawyer who represents the ecuadorian villagers urged forst to act on the letter which was sent in november“the extrajudicial abuse suffered by the human rights defenders in ecuador is bad enough” said page who also signed the letter “but this latest abuse which manipulates court systems to serve chevron’s aim of demonizing its adversaries is particularly insidious we urge the rapporteur not to shy away from this issue just because institutions of a powerful country like the united states are involved” a usbased legal advisor to the communities since the inception of the case also urged dr forst to act “chevron’s crimes fraud and retaliatory litigation in more than courts around the world might constitute one of the greatest abuses of the civil justice system ever” said donziger a primary target of chevron’s intimidation campaign“we respectfully call on dr forst to focus his attention immediately on the thousands of vulnerable ecuadorians who live under an effective death sentence because of chevron’s toxic dumping and its refusal to comply with court orders” he added “chevron’s attempts to silence the very people it poisoned and to deny them access to justice are gross violations of international human rights law”the un designated dr forst to protect human rights defenders from harassment and retaliation from governments and private corporations as special rapporteur forst acts as an independent expert appointed to investigate complaints and report to the united nations human rights council he has the right to pressure governments and nonstate actors – including private corporations – as part of his mandatethe un letter explains how chevron began an avowed “demonization” campaign against adversary counsel intended to drive them from the case so the company’s victims would be left defenseless chevron’s tactics included manufacturing evidence bribing witnesses pressuring ecuador’s president to quash the case paying for testimony filing numerous retaliatory cases and using dozens of private investigators “to spy on the defenders every move including their privileged conversations with their attorneys”paul paz y mino of the environmental group amazon watch which has helped the communities hold chevron accountable also urged the united nations to get involved“we estimate that chevron has spent well over billion to pay law firms and lawyers to battle these impoverished communities and their lawyers using unethical and illegal tactics” paz said “despite chevron’s massive expenditures these heroic communities have won they must be allowed to collect their judgment the united nations has an obligation to play a major role to ensure that the fundamental human rights of those who won the judgment are protected” the term “human rights defender” was adopted by the united nations in on the anniversary of the united nations charter considered the seminal human rights document in the world the right of human rights defenders – including ecuadorian community leaders and their lawyers to advocate freely without retaliation is in itself an international human rights that chevron has violated according to the letterfor a un document explaining the special protections provided under international law to human rights defenders see chevron has a long history of targeting its adversaries on the ecuador litigation with intimidation and threats according to a lengthy evidentiary record compiled by the villagers chevron tried in violation of international law to deny the right of the villagers to access the judicial system by trying to sabotage the legal proceedings in ecuador according to this by ecuadorian

__label__Activism __label__Environment toronto jan  chevron is under fire in canada for violating a unanimous order of the country’s supreme court that ecuadorian rainforest villagers be allowed to try to seize the oil giant’s assets to force it to comply with a billion pollution judgment in their home country according to the filed in the action chevron’s latest attempt to block the ecuadorian villagers from canada’s courts – based on an argument already rejected by canadian judges including the country’s entire supreme court – is yet another “attempt to delay and derail” a collection action that is the best chance for the villagers to remediate the billions of gallons of toxic waste dumped onto their ancestral lands according to a filing by a prominent litigator who is leading the actionall eighteen appellate judges in ecuador and canada to hear the case have now ruled against chevron yet the company is still using four law firms in canada to try to thwart the villagers from commencing their enforcement action chevron already stripped its assets from ecuador to evade paying the pollution judgment forcing the villagers to chase the company into other countries to seize assets for the courtmandated cleanup “it is clear that chevron is now willing to go to war with canada’s supreme court to evade cleaning up the billions of gallons of toxic waste it dumped on indigenous ancestral lands in the rainforest” said a leader of the ecuadorian communities that won the judgment against chevron “the constant delays are part of chevron’s designed strategy of perpetual litigation that has lasted for more than two decades said yanza during this time many indigenous groups have literally begun to die off from the companys poisoning of the forest this is beyond upsetting and we trust canada’s courts will see through chevron’s abusive and unethical strategy after last september in a resounding decision the company infuriated the villagers by quickly filing yet another motion before an ontario trial court to defeat jurisdiction as part of a “decadeslong campaign of delay and evasion” said lenczner in its decision the canada supreme court had ordered the enforcement action against chevron to proceed immediately “deep pockets against the resources of indigenous people in the ecuadorian amazon and repeated interminable delay until ‘hell freezes over’ are chevron’s weapons” lenczner argued in the brief he asserted chevron’s repeated jurisdictional arguments are “futile” and violate four separate decisions by the canada supreme court which require courts to facilitate the enforcement process and not permit a defendant to relitigate issues already decided in the forum where it accepted jurisdiction the law is the same in the united states and most countries “in this case chevron corporation defended itself in ecuador in an eight year trial” lenczner asserted in the motion “it then appealed the judgment against it to the intermediate court of appeal it further appealed the decision to the national court of cassation ecuador’s highest court chevron corporation has had its day in court yet refuses to abide by the judgment” “no canadian litigant would receive as extensive access to justice as did chevron corporation” lenczner added quoting language from a canadian appellate ruling against chevron lenczner said the case “cries out for assistance not unsolicited and premature barriers” of the type chevron is trying to erect to block the proceeding lenczner also added that a motion by chevron canada the company’s whollyowned subsidiary that an ontario trial court had no jurisdiction over it “even thought it had an office and employees in ontario and carried on business sales in ontario was patently without merit” chevron’s various motions to block jurisdiction in canada “were dismissed by three levels of court judges being unanimous” said lenczner in the motion “nevertheless they took over three years to resolve” the showdown in canada between the villagers and the world’s thirdlargest oil company is hugely significant chevron’s assets in canada are said to be worth billion and are more than enough to cover the entirety of the billion ecuador judgment for which interest is running at approximately million annually under canadian law in canada chevron owns oil fields a network of gasoline stations bank accounts and a series of leases and office buildings that collectively produce roughly billion annually in dividends chevron ceo john watson also has rejected multiple offers by the communities to settle the case putting added pressure on his expensive legal strategy which includes and lawyers worldwide in recent years several watson’s scorched earth approach and urged the company to settle the matter the supreme court of canada’s decision for the villagers followed a an intermediate appellate court in canada against chevron which also granted them jurisdiction to seize company assets in the united states a us federal appellate court in new york also ruled in after chevron brought a similar action that the villagers had the legal right to enforce their judgment anywhere in the world instead of respecting the canada supreme court decision chevron filed a motion in november demanding the right to engage in a new round of discovery so it can relitigate issues that had been resolved by three layers of courts in ecuador including the country’s highest court said lenczner evidence in the ecuador case was extensive and included expert technical reports chemical sampling results and a record of pages supplemented by additional pages of material submitted by chevron during the appellate process those who won the ecuador judgment including members of five indigenous groups and dozens of farmer communities originally filed their claims against chevron in new york in in the case shifted to ecuador at chevron’s request after the company agreed to accept jurisdiction there and abide by any judgment chevron later started to obstruct the court process in ecuador as the mounted ultimately because of chevron’s strategy to undermine the proceedings the case took years to conclude in ecuador and the same is now happening in canada said yanza the villagers have complained for years that chevron is engaged in a game of forum shopping and delay to evade its responsibilities for polluting the rainforest for background on chevron’s forum shopping see for a summary of independent media reports documenting chevron’s pollution in ecuador see chevron’s latest attempt to obstruct the canada enforcement action also comes after the villagers have gained significant momentum in the case for a summary of the company’s growing problems in related to the ecuador liability see separately a private investor arbitration panel overseeing a related dispute between chevron and ecuador’s government recently to make matters worse recently surfaced from a chevron whistleblower showing company scientists trying to hide pollution from the ecuador court outside the courtroom chevron was humiliated when it won a in davos for being named the worst corporation on the planet due to a poor environmental record in ecuador and elsewhere,

__label__Activism  new york ny nov  chevron has quietly renewed its controversial contract to pay a hefty salary to its star witness in the ecuador pollution case even after he admitted committing perjury on the stand to try to taint the billion environmental judgment against the oil giant according to sworn testimony recently made available to the publicchevron’s move to renew the contract with alberto guerra at a salary of annually was blasted by advocates for the indigenous and farmer communities who have accused the oil giant of trying to corrupt legal proceedings to evade paying for its courtordered cleanup in ecuador one group said it was preparing to ask the department of justice to investigate the oil company over the payments which is said amounted to “witness bribery”“money talks but gold screams” guerra was famously quoted as saying in a taped conversation when meeting in ecuador with chevron’s investigators who were seeking his cooperation“it is unethical illegal and utterly shocking that chevron continues to pay huge sums to a completely discredited witness who has admitted to repeatedly lying and accepting bribes to testify falsely in court” said paul paz y miño a director at the environmental group amazon watch and a supporter of the villagers who won the judgment “this arrangement is worthy of a criminal investigation and we are asking the department of justice to look into it we consider chevron to have engaged in witness bribery”several news outlets recently that chevron’s total payments to guerra have surpassed million and are continuing under the terms of a new contract that has not been disclosed publicly chevron’s prior contract with guerra also paid him monthly for no work other than to cooperate with the company as a witness it also provided health insurance for guerra and several family members payments to lawyers who are handling his immigration and other issues payments to an accountant a housing allowance and a car the first contract chevron signed with guerra began in and ran for two years before expiring last january according to guerra’s recent testimony in an arbitration proceeding between chevron and ecuador’s government guerra testified in the proceeding that he had only in the bank when he struck the deal with the oil companychevron’s arrangement with guerra appears to violate that prohibits paying for witness testimony and again calls into question the ethics of the oil giant’s lead outside lawyers at the firm gibson dunn crutcher gdc gdc is for allegations it has falsified evidence for chevron and another client the african nation of djibouti a leading national authority on professional ethics in the law dean erwin chemerinsky of the university of california at irvine also chevron’s practice of paying witnesses for their testimonyless wellknown is the slew of other benefits the oil giant has showered on guerra since it moved him to the united states in january of to play a central role in the company’s retaliatory “racketeering” or rico case against the ecuadorian villagers who obtained the environmental judgment that case –which was harshly criticized by participants as a and a dickensian farce was heard in late in and is currently under appealmore details of chevron’s payments recently were disclosed with the public release of pages of transcripts from the arbitration proceeding the transcripts demonstrate guerra’s testimony during the rico case unraveled as the witness admitted he lied on the stand as reported in and by the environmental group amazon watch among the many benefits guerra has now admitted receiving from chevron according to payments to one of america’s most prominent immigration attorneys to help guerra and several family members – including three of his adult children obtain political asylum in the united states apparently based on the false pretense that guerra faced threats in ecuador after the government threatened to prosecute him for perjury the value of this service is estimated to be at least for a personal attorney in the us who was by guerra’s side constantly including during each of the days that the gdc lawyers coached the witness before putting on the stand the value of this service over three years is estimated to be a minimum of million and possibly much higherpayments by chevron for a separate tax attorney and accountant for guerrapayments of all of guerra’s income taxes based on an annual salary of and the other benefits receivedluis yanza a representative of the villagers and a winner of the prestigious goldman environmental prize took aim at chevron for “corrupting” the judicial process by paying witnesses and moving its operatives out of ecuador after they committed perjury“chevron and its lawyers gave a key witness cash out of a suitcase to falsify evidence to taint the ecuador judgment so the company does not have to pay for the cleanup of oil pollution that is causing grave harm to thousands of people” he said “this is just one example of the company’s plan to threaten judges and sabotage the proceedings in ecuador”previously it was reported that guerra had virtually no funds in his bank account when chevron lawyer andres rivero and chevron investigator yohi ackerman handed him in cash out of a backpack in exchange for his cooperation ultimately chevron lawyer randy mastro of gdc personally negotiated witness payments to guerra in chicago at exactly the same time the firm was working with him on a sworn affidavit that claimed the plaintiffs bribed the trial judge – an allegation since and other corroborating facts provided by guerra that undermine his original storyguerra also testified “i lied” about a supposed bribe offer from the villagers that federal judge lewis a kaplan relied on when ruling in favor of chevron in the company’s rico proceeding which has been criticized as highly flawed and falling well below international standards of due process more than international law scholars from countries to overturn kaplan’s ruling saying it violates international law numerous us civil society organizations including amnesty international and amazon watch also have filed urging that the kaplan decision be tossedguerra also admitted during the arbitration proceeding that he lied about key evidence that kaplan found “corroborated” the claim that the trial judgment was written by the plaintiffs guerra said shipping records from a domestic airline that showed documents being sent from him to the trial judge had nothing to do with the chevron pollution case directly contradicting his prior testimony before kaplansteven donziger a longtime us legal advisor to the affected communities who was a target of chevron’s rico case criticized chevron and said he was preparing a formal complaint against the company and its lawyers“it is indisputable that chevron and its lawyers paid a witness to try to frame me and my colleagues pablo fajardo and luis yanza in the rico matter and then tried desperately to hide the fact the false narrative unraveled in the arbitration proceeding” said donziger who with his counsel recently to chevron and its law firms ordering them to cease the destruction of documents in anticipation of further litigation donziger last week also with a federal appellate court explaining how guerra’s new admissions further undermine chevron’s rico casedonziger said chevron’s lawyers have committed another “major ethical violation” by refusing for several months to disclose guerra’s admissions of lying made during the separate arbitration proceeding despite the pendency of an appeal of the kaplan rico decision on precisely the same issuesother attorneys – including the highly respected – have suggested that chevron lawyers mastro and avi weitzman of gdc face potential criminal liability for knowingly presenting false testimony the duo led the coaching of guerra in the gibson dunn offices for days before he testified before judge kaplan as to facts he later conceded were untrue according to the transcriptsfor more background on how guerra has repeatedly changed his story as new facts disprove his earlier versions see published by the huffington post by lawyers for donziger provides a detailed factual history of chevron’s misconduct in the litigation and this by ecuadorian lawyer juan pablo saenz documents some of chevron’s corrupt tacticsthis provided by a company whistleblower also documents how the company had a strategy to hide pollution from the court during the ecuador

environmental contamination in the amazon the key witness in chevrons countersuit has admitted under oath to making up accusations of bribery and ghostwritingas reported by and today in the parallel legal dispute between chevron and the ecuadorian government before an arbitration tribunal reveal that alberto guerra a disgraced exjudge who became the lynchpin of chevrons rico suit against ecuadorians and their legal team as a means to avoid paying the billion judgment admits yes sir i lied therei wasnt being truthful when asked about his accusation that plaintiffs legal team offered him a bribe to rule in their favorthe transcripts also discuss forensic evidence which disprove guerras prior claim that the plaintiffs ghostwrote the final judgment against chevron he admitted as much on the witness stand testifying that he knowingly introduced false and misleading evidence at the rico trial and that the company offered him more money if he could produce evidence or copies of a ‘ghostwritten draft judgment he could not we were unable to find the main document guerra recalled chevron saying had we been able to find it we would have been able to offer you a larger amount something like that we have for youthis proves what we knew all along – that chevrons rico trial is a farce said paul paz y miño director of outreach and online strategy at amazon watch guerra has so thoroughly perjured himself he should be behind bars and so should chevron management chevron has taken the people of ecuador and the us court system on a ride full of lies deliberate delay and obstruction of justice this is vindication for the ecuadorians and counsel steven donziger and we now hope chevron will finally do the right thing and clean up their toxic mess continued paz y miñoguerras testimony shines new light on the extent of chevrons payments to him for his false testimony some per month plus other perks which included a car health care and relocating him and his family to the united states were talking about for admits guerra additionally guerra admits there was no intervention by the ecuadorian government and in fact it was chevron who sought to obstruct justice and corrupt the process the only time the government tried to insert itself into the private litigation was in chevrons favor when in the company sought to have the case thrown out after it was sent to ecuador by a new york trial judge at chevrons requestthe case was originally filed in in new york against texaco for spilling some million gallons of crude billion gallons of toxic wastewater and leaving behind toxic waste pits creating a health crisis for indigenous and farmer communities who live within the companys one million hectare rainforest oil concession after merging with chevron the case was sent to ecuador after the company provided extensive evidence of the independence and transparency of the ecuadorian judiciary after a tenyear trial and hundreds of thousands of soil and water samples that proved ongoing contamination from the companys former sites – even well sites the company claims to have cleaned up – chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay billion for environmental remediation health care and clean water to indigenous and farmer communities who have long suffered from the companys drill and dump practices between and verdict was upheld by three layers of ecuadorian courts – including the countrys supreme court yet chevron has refused to abide by the judgment instead stripping its assets from the country and forcing rainforest residents to pursue the company in other jurisdictions around the worldin its efforts to avoid paying and further delay the already decadeslong struggle for justice chevron filed a countersuit using the rico statute in new york courts claiming the ecuadorians and legal team bribed the ecuadorian judge and ‘ghostwrote the judgment for him simultaneously chevron also filed an arbitration suit against the ecuadorian government hedging its bets in case it lost the original aguinda v chevron case and hoping to force the government to pay for any clean up if the company were found liable the arbitration trial is now coming back to haunt chevron as evidence continues to surface undermining the companys arguments and witnesses in the rico casein a statement by steven donziger – the focus of chevrons attacks in the rico case and target of guerras main accusations of offering a bribe to ghostwrite the final judgment against chevron he explains the latest iteration of guerras testimony proves clearly that chevron paid its star witness huge sums of money to present false evidence to frame the very people in ecuador the company poisoned the disclosure of the latest corrupt and falsified witness testimony from guerra demonstrates once and for all that chevrons socalled racketeering case has completely fallen apart and that ceo john watson needs to be held personally accountable for the legal violations involved donziger recently informed chevron to retain and not destroy documents alluding to a possible future suit against the company and its lawyers for malicious prosecution fraud and corruptionthe guerra revelations are the tip of the iceberg of a pattern of fraud committed by chevron in the case show chevron contractors attempting to undermine the trial in ecuador by only searching for clean soil samples of contaminated areas – a task that proved difficult given the extent of the contaminationpast drilling operations were also replete with deceitful practices the well sites were designed to pollute hiding undisclosed waste pits and dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste upstream from where indigenous and farmer communities bathe fish and drink a sham cleanup was little more than covering waste pits with dirt transcripts released last week and reported by vice show that the tribunal conducted four site visits to contaminated sitessome of which were allegedly cleaned up by chevronbut new tests show they are still toxicthe revelations from the arbitration tribunal on guerras testimony and site visits by the panel are likely to loom large as the second circuit reviews the rico case and canadas supreme court unanimously agreed to allow ecuadorian communities the right to seek company assets as a way of enforcing the billion owed to them we expect based on these new revelations that completely undermine the foundation of chevrons rico case the us federal appeals court must be considering throwing it out in its entirety said paul paz y

__label__Environment __label__Human-Rights toronto oct  the latest document filed in ontario by lawyers for the villagers and available blasts chevron for trying to use the canadian proceeding to relitigate legal and factual issues already repeatedly decided against the company by courts in ecuador and the united states chevron has vowed to fight the villagers who filed their initial claims over chevron’s pollution years ago “until hell freezes over” and beyond“all of chevron corp’s defenses fail” in the enforcement action because “the issues that chevron corp seeks to relitigate have been determined against it by the courts of ecuador” asserted the filing made by canadian litigator alan lenczner of the law firm lenczner slaght in toronto“no aspect of the merits of the case whether factual or legal can be tried or raised in canada” the filing addedthe latest filing sets up a major showdown in canada over the scope of the enforcement proceeding which began in and was delayed for three years while chevron appealed an early decision granting jurisdiction to the villagers in early september canada’s supreme court that the villagers could proceed to try to collect assets in canada against both chevron and its canadian subsidiary chevron canada for background on the winning appellate court decision see in ecuador’s supreme court unanimously affirmed a judgment finding chevron had deliberately dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest decimating indigenous groups and causing an outbreak of cancer for background on the humanitarian crisis caused by the dumping see this and this of the company’s victimsargument in canada on the preliminary motion of the villagers to knock out chevron’s defenses and accelerate the enforcement proceeding will be held in early march if the villagers win that motion chevron’s strategy of “perpetual litigation” will be dealt a severe blow and the proceeding could move quickly to a debt collection phase where the company’s assets will be directly in playeven if the villagers do not win the preliminary motion the enforcement action by its very nature will avoid relitigating the merits of the environmental case and questions of ecuadorian law although the process will take longer said aaron page a us legal advisor to the ecuadoriansthe goal of the villagers in canada is to get their judgment recognized so it will be treated as “domesticated” under canadian law he added such a ruling would enable the villagers to seize chevron’s assets in any province in canada it also would facilitate potential debt collection by the villagers in other countries that have reciprocal judgment enforcement agreements with canada chevron owns a large crude oil refinery in british columbia a large interest in a tar sands project in alberta another interest in an offshore oil field off the coast of newfoundland various leases in the northwest territories and a network of gasoline stations under the chevron brand all told chevron has an estimated billion in assets in canada that kick off roughly billion annually in profits for company shareholdersthe oil giant refuses to pay the ecuador judgment despite having accepted jurisdiction there in as a condition of shifting the litigation from new york to the south american nation because interest runs on the judgment the amount that could be seized is just north of billion and is rising steadily said luis yanza a rainforest leader and who works with the dozens of amazon communities that have sued chevron for damages“we again urge chevron to stop the gamesmanship and comply with its legal obligations to the very people of ecuador that it exploited mercilessly for decades by dumping toxic waste onto their ancestral lands” said yanza“chevron is a deadbeat debtor to the people of ecuador and should be treated as such by the court system of canada” he addedin its most recent filing in canada chevron’s lawyers raised factual defenses already decided against it by three layers of courts in ecuador including in unanimous decisions by an intermediate appellate court and the country’s supreme court the latter decision which meticulously documented the extensive evidence of contamination at hundreds of former chevron well sites can be read the ecuadorian villagers have been gaining momentum recently in the longrunning litigation which began in when the original pollution claims were filed in new york chevron moved the case to ecuador in after filing numerous expert affidavits praising the country’s court system at the time chevron had never been held liable in a court in ecuador for even one dollar of environmental damages even though the contamination caused under the texaco brand had been visible and widespread for decadesin all eight separate appellate judges in ecuador affirmed the underlying judgment against chevron separately all appellate judges in canada to hear chevron’s arguments to block the enforcement proceeding have ruled for the villagers in addition the villagers in won an important appeals court decision in new york nullifying an illegal injunction sought by chevron purporting to block enforcement of the ecuador judgment anywhere in the worldin its defense in canada chevron claims that the ecuadorian courts had no jurisdiction over it but that issue was decided against the company in unanimous decisions by ecuador’s supreme court and by a us federal appellate court the company also claims it is not liable for pollution caused in ecuador by texaco but that issue also was decided against the company in both the us and ecuador given that chevron and texaco merged in also claims the findings of us judge louis a kaplan in its retaliatory “racketeering” case in where the company alleged the ecuador litigation was a “sham” should be adopted by canada’s courts even though the judge had no jurisdiction and refused to admit any evidence of the company’s pollution judge kaplan’s flawed findings have no relevance to the canadian action according to the filing of the villagers for background on the kaplan decision see chevron is also trying to use the legal defense of “corporate separateness” to claim the assets of its whollyowned canadian subsidiary should be immune from seizure the villagers point out in their latest filing that chevron corp completely controls its subsidiary in canada and that shell entities cannot be used to avoid the collection of a valid debt in any event canada’s supreme court in its recent decision rejected chevron’s claim that “corporate separateness” should block the enforcement action from commencingthe villagers have charged that chevron for years has engaged in abusive litigation tactics and played a jurisdictional shell game to evade the ecuador court judgment several years ago with the evidence against it mounting chevron general counsel charles james said openly the company would fight the villagers “until hell freezes over” and then “fight it out on the ice” if necessary internal chevron emails describe efforts to “demonize” adversary counselbackground on chevron’s forum shopping and shifting arguments can be found and the canadian action also comes after a private investor arbitration panel overseeing a related dispute between chevron and ecuador’s government chevron’s main defense that a government release barred the claims of the villagers that defense has been rejected now by the courts of three countries although chevron is trying to use it again to block the enforcement proceeding in canadaoutside the courtroom chevron has fared no better it recently won a public eye for being the worst corporation on the planet as a result of its horrendous environment record in ecuador and

proven to be tricky caps are so small that they often fall through the cracks of recycling machinery a “caps on” movement has helped educate america that certain caps can be successfully recycled when screwed onto their bottles however there are still many types of caps that don’t have a recyclable bottle to “carry” it through the system that’s where preserve’s cap recycling program comes into play

nationwide preserve will then turn those caps into new products like the preserve toothbrush the long term vision is to have a caps recycling program established in schools nationwide “we believe a school recycling program coupled with additional solutions to recycle america’s caps through municipal programs will result in significant steps to stop this problem at the source and greatly reduce the need to clean wayward caps from our waterways and keep them away from marine life” says eric hudson anna cummins executive director of gyres agrees “ gyres finds copious amounts of plastic bottle

national newspaper he founded the national post he never contacted representatives of the ecuadorian villagers before publication black also relied for much of his analysis on testimony from a paid at least million by the company who has since conceded he perjured himself in open courtin a chicago jury related to the sale of his various newspapers which at one point comprised one of the largest media empires in the world the jury found that black misled investors and looted funds from a public company to support a lavish lifestyle that included the use of private jets and luxury homes around the world for more on blacks checkered past see in vanity fairblack was incarcerated in a federal prison for approximately four years before being deported to canada and barred from reentering the united states for years the blog put out by representatives of the villagers challenged black for using a double standard in his analysis“the canada supreme court decision is typical in cases where a scofflaw debtor tries to evade a court judgment by selling off its assets in one country and moving them to another” the blog stated “thats what chevron did in ecuador after it fought for years to venue the trial there and accepted jurisdiction“when a defendant loses a case and runs from the law the judgment creditor always has a right to ask another countrys courts to enforce their judgment against the defendants assets but according to chevron and its new surrogate mr black an exception to this rule should be made for the longsuffering ecuadorian villagers…“of course if this were a commercial enforcement case involving one of blacks businesses that was getting stiffed in another country he would be the first to cheer the canada supreme court decision”the villagers have criticized chevron for playing a to block collection of the ecuador judgment while in the impacted area continue to cause suffering to thousands of people chevron also faces a host of other problems because of the claims of the villagers which were initially filed in us federal court in before the company had the litigation moved to ecuadorchevron’s discredited star witness the ecuadorian citizen alberto guerra in a retaliatory us racketeering trial used by chevron to try to taint the ecuador judgment in apparent violation of us federal law chevron paid guerra huge sums for his testimony even though he had only in his bank account at the time chevron also moved guerra and several family members out of ecuador to the united stateschevron later conceded its lawyers at the firm gibson dunn crutcher coached guerra for days before he testified that a “bribe” occurred in the ecuador case guerra has provided no corroborating evidence for his assertion and has conceded he lied on numerous occasions before a us federal judge as this and this explainthe work of some of chevron’s outside lawyers at gibson dunn also has with allegations that they knowingly falsified evidence in the chevron case and in another highprofile matter in london a federal judge in oregon already for harassing a nonprofit legal organization that was helping the ecuadorian villagers “without the discredited guerra available to testify in canada chevron has no real defense” the blog asserted “which is why chevron and mr black argue that canadas courts should not take up the case at all” ,

drug resistance further illness or disability or even death all medicine categories are affected be it originators’ or generic prescriptiononly or overthecounter medicines “counterfeit medicines which are mainly linked to organized crime have considerably grown in recent years given the high profits and opportunities offered to criminals including through the spread of ecommerce yet in many

__label__Activism  ottawa sep  in a decision that could have important implications for human rights victims worldwide canada’s supreme court on friday will announce whether ecuadorian villagers can proceed in canadian courts to try to seize chevron’s assets to force the oil giant to comply with a billion ecuadorian environmental judgment if the court decides in favor of the villagers the decision could pose a substantial risk to chevron’s large asset base in canada the oil giant owns offshore oil fields a tar sands investment and a refinery in the country that collectively are worth an estimated billion and produce an estimated billion to billion annually in profitsthe decision also could pave the way for human rights victims to more easily obtain compensation from private companies that try to hide their assets in overseas subsidiaries as a way to evade paying civil judgments in environmental cases according to experts and others following the twodecade litigation“canada’s supreme court will be making a critically important decision that hopefully will create some muchneeded clarity around this longrunning dispute” said paul paz y miño a campaigner for the us environmental group amazon watch which works closely with the ecuadorian villagers“if the decision is in favor of the ecuadorians chevron will face a real threat to a hugely important asset pool in one of the top energy producing countries of the world” he said “in addition the decision could make it easier for courts in other countries to let the villagers seize chevron assets as chevron is currently making the same technical arguments to block the case elsewhere that it is making in canada “on the other hand if canada rules for chevron the villagers will still be left with viable legal options in other countries but they likely will take much longer to come to fruition playing into chevron’s game of obstruction and delay” he addedecuadorian indigenous leader humberto piaguaje who heads the coalition of rainforest communities suing chevron underscored the significance of the decision “thousands of suffering people in communities spread out over the amazon are praying canada’s courts quickly move our request to trial so it can finally be determined whether chevron will be forced to clean up the horrific contamination caused to our ancestral lands” he said “the health of the rainforest and the lives of many people being exposed to chevron’s toxic chemicals depend on it”the impending decision is the product of chevron’s appeal of a unanimous ruling by an ontario appellate court in ordering that the villagers be allowed to pursue chevron’s assets in the form of a judgment collection action the ecuadorians are represented by prominent canadian trial lawyer alan lenczner who argued the case on their behalf before the country’s supreme courtthe ontario appeals court had rejected chevron’s technical argument that the ecuadorians should be denied jurisdiction because the company’s assets in canada are held not by chevron but by a whollyowned subsidiary chevron canada“for years chevron has contested the legal proceedings of every court involved in the litigation – in the united states ecuador and canada” the threejudge panel of the ontario appeals court “in these circumstances the ecuadorian plaintiffs should have an opportunity to attempt to enforce the ecuadorian judgment in a court where chevron will have to respond on the merits” it added if the canada supreme court affirms that decision the subsequent enforcement trial will largely concern whether ecuadorian courts gave chevron a fair hearing – an issue hotly disputed by the parties as chevron claims it was the victim of “fraud” in ecuador chevron raised the allegations in the ecuador proceeding but two separate appellate courts and a trial judge rejected them after reviewing the evidence the villagers accuse chevron of inventing the “fraud” narrative by paying corrupt witnesses to fabricate evidence trying to bribe judges and deliberately trying to sabotage the ecuador proceeding as a way to hide its own fraudulent and criminal conduct in ecuador see for backgroundthe canadian trial proceeding could begin within one month of a decision in favor of the villagers with the first step being the filing by chevron of a defense in written formthe ecuadorian judgment against chevron which came down in is based on extensive scientific evidence that the oil company dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest when it operated in ecuador under the texaco brand from to it was issued on behalf of an estimated indigenous and farmer villagers from roughly rainforest communities in a mile area in the country’s oriente region for a summary of the evidence against chevron see ecuador’s supreme court affirmed the liability portion of the judgment unanimously in a decision in although it halved the damages to billion by knocking out a punitive penaltychevron not only has refused to pay that judgment but it stripped its assets from ecuador years ago in anticipation of losing the case that forced the villagers to file enforcement actions targeting company assets in canada brazil and argentina the canada action is the most advanced a background document explaining the details of the canadian enforcement action against chevron can be read “knowing it can never win on the merits chevron for more than two decades has been trying to use technicalities to block the courthouse door to the very people it has poisoned in ecuador” said kevin koenig an official with amazon watch “it is the same playbook the company used in the united states to block the original trial chevron tried to use it in ecuador but ended up losing a historic decision on the merits“the question now is whether canada will stop chevron’s abusive litigation tactics and move this matter forward so thousands of suffering people can have the chance to obtain a measure of justice” he said chevron accepted jurisdiction in ecuador in as a condition of the trial being transferred out of us federal court once the trial began chevron not only challenged jurisdiction anyway but its top lawyer vowed a “lifetime of litigation” if the villagers persisted in pursuing their claims since the ecuador judgment was issued chevron has filed more than retaliatory legal actions in the us and other jurisdictions against the named plaintiffs their lawyers their financial supporters and allies in the environmental community the company which in internal emails referred to the effort as a “demonization” campaign has admitted using in the effort one trial judge in the us lewis a kaplan found for chevron last year after a truncated bench trial where he refused to consider any of the pollution evidence against the company and essentially tried to overturn ecuador’s supreme court by blocking the judgment in contrast approximately trial and appellate judges in ecuador and the us have rejected chevron’s claims of fraud in one form or another in decisions over the last five years both at the trial and appellate levels and in the context of discovery actions filed by the company chevrons fraud allegations are based largely on the testimony of a fact witness to whom chevron paid contrary to ethical rules approximately million in cash and benefits and whose testimony has since been proven to be entirely false through indepth computer forensic analyses the central claims in chevrons retaliation campaign are deeply problematic for numerous additional reasons and are likely to be reversed on appeal in the coming months ultimately it is likely that very little of chevron’s retaliatory litigation will be of great consequence if canada’s courts allow the villagers to go forward and the case is resolved there said julio prieto an ecuadorian lawyer for the villagers “chevron’s worst nightmare is that the canadian courts will let the matter proceed to the merits despite the company’s pressure campaign” he said ,

__label__Activism __label__Environment new york sep  a notre dame “human rights” law professor has admitted chevron is paying him to publicly attack ecuadorian villagers and their lawyers who won a historic billion judgment against the company in ecuador according to an analysis published by representatives of the affected communitiesthe analysis which appeared on criticized professor douglas cassel for being an example of “corruption in academia” and said he was violating notre dame’s conflict of interest policy and compromising the university’s academic integrity by not being transparent about his financial relationship with chevron it also called on the notre dame faculty to determine whether cassel is violating university policy “it is pretty clear that cassel is allowing himself to play a central role in a classic oil industry subterfuge” the analysis said “since the corporation chevron that dumped billions of gallons of oil waste into the rainforest has no credibility it tries to enlist a third party academic to launder its agitprop“it is another example of how chevron tries to use money to corrupt institutions whether they be courts or universities” it addedcassel who teaches international human rights law admitted he is being paid by chevron after he came under on various legal blogs for trying to defend the company’s litigation strategy the villagers have demonstrated that many of his writings on the case are rife with factual distortions and other shortcomings of scholarship and generally parrot the company’s legal filings as this points out cassel never commented on the longrunning case considered one of the most significant environmental and human rights litigations ever until chevron began to pay him cassel who often downplays his relationship with chevron by calling himself an “independent” consultant has refused requests to disclose how much his client is paying him or whether he allows the company to edit or review his posts prior to publication these disclosures must be made so his credibility can be assessed by his students peers in academia and the general public said julio prieto a lawyer for the ecuadorian villagers“if a professor is inclined to let himself be used by a giant oil company trying to evade the rule of the law he should at least disclose the details of the financial relationship to his students and fellow faculty so his credibility can be properly assessed” said prieto “it is disturbing that any law school would allow one of its faculty members to engage in acts that appear to compromise the academic integrity of the university and the objectivity of the professor’s scholarship”cassel’s posts generally are based on chevron’s public relations talking points rather than independent research said prieto chevron has a history of trying to use thirdparty academics to “launder” company talking points as part of a broad corporate campaign to undermine the ecuador judgment which is based on extensive scientific evidence including more than technical evidentiary reports according to the analysis the company previously enlisted a global warming skeptic and a former lobbyist for the texas chemical industry as “academics” to advocate its position on the ecuador matter but both left the case after their backgrounds were exposed see and ecuador’s supreme court ruled unanimously in that chevron operating as texaco deliberately discharged billions of gallons of toxic waste into the country’s rainforest in the and causing an and decimating indigenous groups the original case was filed in in new york but moved to ecuador at chevron’s request after the company agreed to jurisdiction there when chevron began to lose the case in its preferred forum of ecuador the company stripped its assets from the country refused to pay the judgment and began to attack the villagers in the united states by claiming the entire was “sham” litigation for a summary of the overwhelming evidence against chevron in the ecuador trial see for a summary of chevron’s attempts to sabotage and corrupt the proceedings in ecuador – including bribery of witnesses and falsification of evidence see this and that show scientists trying to hide evidence of pollution for a segment documenting chevron’s toxic dumping in ecuador see just last week canada’s supreme court issued a groundbreaking ruling allowing the ecuadorians to try to seize chevron’s assets in that country to force compliance with the ecuador judgment see for background after explaining other examples of chevron’s undisclosed payments to academics in the case the legal team’s analysis said that the company’s “lineage with lowgrade ‘academics’ reflects poorly on both cassel’s personal ethics and those of notre dame’s reputable law school” “notre dame should not be letting cassel trade on its credibility to sell his own soul and by extension the university’s to a corporate human rights abuser – particularly when there is no real transparency about the amount of money changing hands and the conditions placed by the company on any ‘research’ for publication” the analysis asserted“while cassel reaps cash for the arrangement notre dame must pay a high cost via its harmed reputation and compromised academic integrity” it added “cassel’s spectacle is made worse by the fact notre dame expressly states that its mission is to help combat poverty oppression and injustice – the very life conditions forced on thousands of indigenous persons and farmers in ecuador by the irresponsible operating practices of cassel’s client” as part of its investigation the analysis called on notre dame to require cassel to disclose any and all of his written agreements with chevron and any email correspondence between the professor and company officials“it would be interesting to know how much cassel charges to compromise his personal ethics the ideals of the human rights movement and the academic integrity of a university” concluded the analysis recently after his relationship with chevron was exposed cassel removed all of his chevronpaid writings from his silo on the university’s official website and placed them on an independent site he appears to have constructed to house his work for the oil company,

__label__Activism  new york ny oct  indigenous villagers and their lawyers have ordered chevron to cease the destruction of all documents related to oil contamination in ecuador’s rainforest in light of compelling new evidence the company presented false witness testimony and committed multiple legal violations in its campaign to evade a billion environmental liability the demand in a to chevron’s lawyers and private investigators indicated the villagers and their counsel are considering a lawsuit against the company and its agents for malicious prosecution fraud defamation and obstruction of justice among other violations the allegations some of which are outlined in earlier filed against the company relate to chevron’s fabrication of evidence and fraudulent coverup of its toxic dumping in ecuadorthe villagers and their lawyers also want to preserve the option of using documents that otherwise might be destroyed in a lawsuit in canada where they are trying to seize chevron’s assets to pay for their judgment said steven donziger the longtime us legal advisor to the villagers donziger signed the letter along with richard friedman a wellknown trial attorney in seattle who represents donziger“this letter is one of the steps the villagers are taking to hold chevron officials and their lawyers personally accountable for falsifying evidence and engaging in an array of illicit activity with the goal of trying to evade responsibility for a courtmandated cleanup of oil pollution in ecuador” said donziger “chevron officials have a disturbing history of destroying or claiming to lose key documents and other critical evidence that points to the company’s culpability” he added “we want to ensure that no longer happens as the villagers press forward to collect their judgment”the demand was made to gibson dunn crutcher chevron’s main outside counsel on the case and a firm by various judges for unethical activity in the ecuador and other matters see for more background the private investigation firms kroll and investigative research inc along with iri’s president oliver douglas beard all suspected of fabricating fake witness testimonies false reports of security threats to chevron officials and engaging in espionage against donziger and his colleagues in the united states and ecuador also targeted by the letter is the miamibased chevron lawyer andres rivero who has admitted to paying tens of thousands of dollars in cash out of a suitcase in an apparent effort to bribe an ecuadorian trial judge to testify falsely against donziger and ecuadorian lawyer pablo fajardo stroz friedberg chevron’s forensic consulting firm and the chevron law firms jones day king spalding and kobre kim all of whom have been involved in litigations that involved the presentation of falsified witness testimony and who have played key roles in the company’s abusive litigation strategy said donzigermuch of the false witness relates to alberto guerra to whom chevron paid at least million in cash and benefits including moving his entire family from ecuador to the united states in exchange for testimony that the trial judge in ecuador was bribed by the plaintiffs guerra’s testimony is full of internal contradictions and has been completely disproven by computer forensic analysis chevron lawyers avi weitzman and randy mastro were involved in coaching him for days before he was allowed to take the stand for more background see and in the huffington post “as more information has come to light it appears likely that you and your client have engaged in fraud extortion malicious prosecution defamation obstruction of justice witness tampering and the manufacture and presentation of false evidence” said the letter “as just one of many examples you were involved in the procurement of false testimony from alberto guerra andor the presentation of that evidence in legal and public forums while knowing it to be false or recklessly disregarding its falsity”the letter also ordered the entities to preserve even privileged documents between attorneys given that the “crime fraud” exception most likely applies to the conduct at issue in after years of litigation repeatedly stymied by chevron’s delaying tactics the villagers won a unanimous environmental judgment against the company from ecuador’s supreme court although chevron had insisted the litigation take place in ecuador the company has since engaged in a in multiple jurisdictions to try to evade paying the judgmentchevron and its agents have a history of destroying documents in the ecuador case to avoid the disclosure of embarrassing information in the the company ordering the destruction of all documents related to oil spills in ecuadortwo years ago chevron’s main outside scientist on the case – john conner of gsi environmental – admitted in a sworn deposition to destroying documents related to various “studies” he had conducted for chevron for the ecuador case conner who was supervised by chevron scientist sara mcmillan is also the author of the that directed company scientists to only lift “clean” soil during the pollution trial in ecuador to hide contamination

 __label__Health-&-Wellness washington dc oct  the merck childhood asthma network inc mcan today released a report “” that examines its impact on childhood asthma care over the past decade as the only organization to focus solely on the burden and associated morbidity of childhood asthma mcan – funded by the merck foundation – worked with partners in local communities as well as other nonprofit organizations foundations and government agencies to respond to this pervasive public health problem the report covers the nature and scope of mcan’s workfrom mcan funded the implementation of evidencebased interventions in impoverished and medically underserved communities mcan was created after decades of increasing disparities in asthma morbidity despite the existence of welldocumented and proven management strategies even today more than six million children in the united states have asthma it is the thirdleading cause of hospitalizations among children under and is also the leading cause of school absenteeism due to a chronic condition accounting for nearly million lost days of school each yearin response to this public health challenge mcan launched phase i of its communitybased model by awarding grants to asthma management programs at five sites in the united states and puerto rico the initial outcomes surpassed expectations emergency room visits among children at mcanfunded sites dropped by percent and percent of the children across all sites missed fewer days of school due to asthma this success was largely attributed to innovative care coordination involving evidencebased interventions use of local care coordinators and creation of communitybased partnerships with organizations on the ground such as city health departments and school districtsmcan project teams ensured the care coordination programs were designed to fit each community’s specific needs a necessary contextual factor for implementation in realworld settings “it takes more than dusting off the clinical research findings and parachuting onesize fits all models into different parts of the country” said dr floyd malveaux executive director merck childhood asthma network “we need to understand how research translates in each community and adapt accordingly”for example in the aftermath of hurricane katrina when allergens from flooding and lack of adequate healthcare could have caused a spike in childhood asthma symptoms mcan and partners provided patienttailored asthma counseling and mitigation of triggers of asthma symptoms to address this extraordinary challenge over months patients in new orleans and surrounding parishes reported that the average number of maximum asthma symptom days plummeted by percentharnessing the experiences and findings from successful phase i strategies mcan launched phase ii by expanding its scope to new and more focused programs the children enrolled in its care coordination sites in the us and puerto rico missed an average of percent fewer days of school after the interventions had been in place for a year as noted in earlier randomized controlled studies tailored healthcare strategies embedded in evidencebased interventions played a crucial role in managing adverse childhood asthma outcomes particularly in highrisk communities “the phase ii outcomes were impressive and demonstrated the impact that care coordination strategies can have” said cynthia rand national advisory board chair mcan and professor of medicine johns hopkins university “mcan’s tailored evidencebased approach in individual communities can make a sustainable change in the quality of asthma care”mcan appreciated the need to address and impact public policy to ensure sustainability of systemic change through adequate reimbursement for services and the way in which guidelinesbased asthma care is provided “we realized early that in order to achieve sustainable change in healthcare settings federal and state level policies for quality care were necessary” said dr malveauxmcan partnered with the environmental protection agency epa to build an online network for asthma programs which will to continue to house the mcan knowledge base beyond the organization consulted with the centers for disease control and prevention and department of housing and urban development to advance quality asthma care and to mitigate exposure to asthma triggers in the home and schools mcan and its partners played a significant role and served as a catalyst for the centers for medicare and medicaid services to provide medicaid funding for asthma care in the school setting as well as expansion of medicaid reimbursement by states for preventive health services provided by professionals other than licensed practitionersas mcan’s funded initiatives conclude later this year its findings experiences and recommendations are a key resource to build and advance the role of implementation science in reducing disparities in childhood asthma outcomes mcan’s impact contributes to the ongoing effort to close the gap between what works in controlled settings and what is done in healthcare practice in the real world asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions among children in more than million children had asthma a number that has grown steadily over the last few decades it also is costly the nation spends between and billion alone on treating childhood asthma more than any other childhood condition additionally indirect costs which include missed school days and lost wages for a parent or
