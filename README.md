## Project Title: Social Impact Investing Recommender 
Team Members: Gloria Zheng, Angel Yu, Anvi Agarwal, Kyle Lai, Hadia Faheem

### Motivation & Objectives: 
It can be difficult to determine which companies to invest in and understand their CSR initiatives and business practices. Our project aims to provide an inclusive platform, where individuals can educate themselves on the CSR initiatives, business practices, and sentiment surrounding different companies theyâ€™re interested in investing in, as well as helping investors potentially discover new companies doing work to help alleviate issues they care about. In addition, users will be able to study stock performance of these companies, access important financial information, build a sample impact investing portfolio, and see which investments are popular among other users as well.

### Directory
- templates: all HTML pages

- textanalysis: 
  - analtext.py : trains,loads & runs the model, need to create a new model when cloning since it was too big to upload.
  - requirements.txt : lists requirements needed for fasttext and g++ compiler
  - categ.train, categ.valid : training and validation data to run the model
  - training_data.csv : news articles scraped using scrapy from ESG site to create training & validation, split 70,30%
  - ESG categories.csv : contains the topics model is trained on. The webserver only has 4 categories since the stock news processed is slightly different which messes with model accuracy for range of categories it can process.
